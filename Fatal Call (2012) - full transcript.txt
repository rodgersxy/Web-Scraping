[*] [Silenced gunshot] So, uh, what mess brought your life here, Mitch? Where do I start? You know, that's kind of an asshole thing to ask, Ted. I never denied who I was, Simon. Settle down. Well, I needed a change of scenery. - My boy Simon here hooked me up. - That's right. What do you say you change the scenery and get us a couple more drinks, huh? Oh, I'll get it. Simon, Simon, let the new guy go. I got it. And you can put it on my tab, too. And loosen up that tie, for God's sakes, You look like an idiot. What is this, a funeral? Bartender? Three beers please, And put them on the tab of the pasty white guy in the blue shirt. Nothing in this world is harder than speaking the truth. Nothing easier... - than flattery! - Than flattery! A Dostoyevsky fan! - Yes. - Wow. - I am impressed. - I am really impressed. That's my favorite book. I love Russian novels, the endings in particular. Oh yes, you've got to love those tragic endings. Yes, they're the best kind, aren't they? Hey Mitch! How you doing on those beers, huh? Oh, God. That guy hit on me last week. Oh, really? How'd he do? Well, I'm here and he's there, so you figure it out. Good point, yeah. Are they friends of yours? Uh, co-workers. Eh, one of them's a buddy. The smart one? Yeah. Hmm. He's afraid of women. No, he's... Yes, he is. Yes, he is. So should I take my beers and... No, we're talking, aren't we? Yeah. Screw him. I'm Mitch. Hi Mitch, I'm Amy. Nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you too. You've probably heard this one before, but, Um, come here often? No, this place was just on my way. To where? To where I'm going. Where are you from? I'm from here, actually. Where are you from? Redmond. Redmond. Wow, you're a long way from home. Long enough What brings you here? Just had to go. We can't run from our problems, Mitch. We have to face them. Tolstoy? Chekhov? - No. - No? Can I buy you drink? Thanks, but, um, I should get going. Do you have a pen? Thanks. Well, just like that, huh? Well, you know your Crime and Punishment. How could I not? Lucky me. We'll see. Call me. Call me on Tuesday. [*] [Train Horn] Burger and brats. Water, please. You okay, buddy? You kidding me? Hey! Hey, that's right! Keep walking, punk! You fucking bastard. Yes, very. Hey, today's the day. Just call her already, will you? Don't you have somebody else to bug, Or maybe a computer server to fix? Server's are fine, Mitch. It's your turn, anyway. - Well, lucky me. - Yeah. We'll see. Oh, hey, did I tell you? I got two tickets for Saturday night's game. You should totally take her, if she'd go with you, Which she probably wouldn't because she's way out of your league. Ha. That's funny. Don't let him give you a hard time, Mitch. He's a curmudgeon. Cur-what now? A jerk. Like Shorty, over here, he's just jealous. So's jackass. You going to let him talk to you like that? Take this boring piece of crap back too. Give me King, Koontz any day, but... Coloring book? Nice. Will you just call her already? The suspense is killing me, Besides, she smells like money. I'd tap that. Ted would do anything for a buck. Who wouldn't? Guys, don't you have somewhere to be? Guys, see you later. All right, all right. Oh, don't forget! I've got tickets. Man, they've got to get these things fixed. Oh! Hey, let me get that for you, Lily. Oh, thanks! You're a sweetheart. - I've been told. - The conference room. All right. What's all this? It's this investigation. Now see, you wouldn't have to do all that heavy lifting If you didn't switch sides of the aisle. Yeah, well, I got tired of defending Guilty people for free. Well, there had to be a few, occasional innocent ones, huh? Yeah, sure. Those are the ones that got me through the day. Take a break. Seriously, take a break. Come on. The "D.A.'s" office never sleeps. Well, they take breaks. So Mitch, what are you doing here? What do you mean? I mean paralegal work. It's not you. Well, Simon got me the job. I figured it's something to do temporarily until I found something else to do, and I kind of like it. You hang out with Simon and Ted a lot, huh? Well, Simon I grew up with. Uh, Ted, I don't know him at all. Yeah, watch out for that guy. I guarantee you he's going to be one of those jerky attorneys We hear about in the news. Thanks for the warning. - Sorry to interrupt. - Hi, guys. Mitch, this is, uh, Detective Zyler and Detective Koduri. - Hey. - Hi. Here's the stuff you asked for. Could you please not smoke in here? Does it look like it's lit? Technically, he's right. [Ring tone] Hello? Amy! Yes. Hey, it's, it's Mitch. We met the other night at the... I know where we met, Mitch. Listen, I was wondering if maybe you would like to go out With me some time, you know? Or maybe grab some dinner. How about today? Really? Come on, be adventurous, Mitch. Let's do something this evening. I'm sure I could think of something. Hey. What? What's your problem, man? What the hell was that? I don't know what you're talking about. What are you doing here, man? You don't look like you belong. It's a long story. Oh, what happened to you, the old lady beat you up? [Laughing] You could say that. Yeah, whatever. Give me your money. You're robbing me now? No, no. I'm not robbing you. The way I see it, you owe me for a new jacket, A new shirt, and a new beer. So just give me your money. All right, I'm sorry about that. - I'll get you the money. - Yeah, yeah. I think I'll start with this, too. You can't have that. Like hell. Like hell! Where's he at? Go, go, go! Don't let him get away! Go! You are like a lost puppy. Are you looking to rescue me? I don't know. Do you need rescuing? I haven't yet. Interesting choice for a date. I don't know, I thought It be something different. It is. And so are you. Oh yeah? How so? Well, you're, um, Kind of shy, A little reserved, nice. Different from the jerks that I normally attract. You keep secrets. You keep secrets too. I do. Maybe I'm the one that needs rescuing. I, you read people pretty well. It keeps me alive. [*] [*] What are we? What? What are we? What do you mean, what are we? I mean, what are we? You mean, like, are we in a relationship? Yeah, something like that, I guess. You want to be in a relationship with me? Well, based on that incredible conversation that we just had, I think that it might work. Yeah? Yeah. When was your last relationship? It ended a couple of years ago. What happened? Well, what do you want to know? What happened? Bad things. Love triangle sort of things. Tell me about it. What does it matter? It was a long time ago. I want to know your secrets. All right. But you've got to tell me all your secrets, too. Fair enough. [Knock] Amy! Amy! - Who is that? - Nobody. It's nobody. How does he know your name? Get your ass home! Now! - He's not here for you. - Who is it? Who is he? Look, he's gone, okay? - It's nobody. - Who is it? Who is he? It's my husband. Your what? No, we're sepa... we're separated. I wanted, I wanted to tell you. Oh, when were you going to tell me? I was going to tell you. Who is he? He's nobody. He's a used car salesman. He owns a used car dealership, okay? He's, he's a drunk, abusive son-of-a-bitch. That about sums it up. You should have told me. I'm sorry. I can't believe this. I'm sorry. Ooh! I was going to tell you. I just told you, I just told you... I just told you what happened with... I'm sorry. Please. I was going to tell you. I'm sorry. [*] Excuse me. I'm really sorry. Oh! Hey, hey. - End of the line, pal. - I need to get inside, okay? Get to the end of the line before I dot your other eye. Okay, you really want to do this? That's fine with me, fine. This is official "D.E.A." business. I need to see your boss. And when this all goes down, I can tell him you cooperated or you didn't. What's it going to be? Go ahead, man. Out of my sight. [*] Good day, sir! Hi. Look, if you want to park your car here, We're probably going to have to sell it. Oh, maybe we can work out a trade in or something. Well, I'm sure we'll have something you'll like. You the owner? No, no, no, I'm just one of the salesmen. Mitch. Rick. - Let's take a look. - All right. I'll take it from here, Rick. Oh, you got the owner. Thanks. Hey. - You looking for the owner? - No, not in particular. I was just, I thought maybe he was... They sure are beautiful, aren't they? Yeah. And they give a great ride, too. What's the best car on the lot? That one over there. Unfortunately it's not for sale. It's mine. I wouldn't be caught dead in anything else. So what are you in the market for? Oh, I've been looking for a while. I was hoping to get something like what you've got. Thanks. But I think we can find something that you want. As long as I can afford it, right? There's always a catch, isn't there? Listen, you take as much time as you need in my lot. If there's anything you want... You let me or my people know. All right. Thank you. My pleasure. That was dangerous. Mitch, what if... hey! What if he found out about us? You should just leave him. It's not that easy. - People do it all the time. - You know what? You don't, my God, you don't understand. I would divorce him for you, But it would be simpler if he were... What, dead? Can we get away with it? He's got a lot of enemies. Just serve him the papers, And then leave him. Okay. Does he suspect anything? No, he's too self-absorbed. * I want to party all night, * I want to fuck all day. * I want to do something freaky to you, baby, * *I don't want to play no games. * I want to party all night, * I want to fuck all day. * I want to do something freaky to you, baby, * *I don't want to play no games. * I want to touch your body, * I want to taste your sweat. * I want to do something freaky to you, baby, * * see how freaky we get. *I don't want to ease your head, I just want to make you sweat.* * You can't be hard to get * You ain't seen nothing yet. * I want to party all night, * I want to fuck all day. * I want to do something freaky to you, baby, * *I don't want to play no games. Check them out. All the women here are so hot. You know, I met my first wife here, a long time ago. What a nightmare that turned out to be. God, you meet the wrong woman And she will destroy your entire life. Now that I know your secret, I should probably tell you mine. I killed someone. What? I shot him. It was a hunting accident. It was a... Small town. You know how that can be. I had to get out of there. I'm sorry. What made you marry a guy like that? I don't know. I just made some bad choices. Runs in the family. Father? No. I didn't know my dad, it was my stepfather. He was a drunk and he used to beat my mom. But he did her the favor of dropping dead, But she hated men the rest of her life. She passed away? Yeah. Doctor called it lung cancer, I called it life cancer. I tried marrying up. In some ways, I did. In most ways, I didn't. Do you think any less of me? Of course not. We do what we can to survive, right? Yeah. He leaves for business on Tuesday. I'll serve him at the airport. He's going to be pissed, so It's probably best if I'm not there when he returns. I'll stay at that hotel. You'll help me move? Of course. Okay. I don't want to raise any suspicions, So maybe we shouldn't talk before then. Come by at four. Is that okay? Sure. Don't worry if you see his car there. He always takes a cab to the airport when he travels. Just come around back, I'll be waiting for you. You okay? Yeah. Yes. I love you. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. I haven't seen you in a dog's year. You wanted to see me? What? I own this place. You told my doorman you wanted to see me. Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah I did. Wait a minute, you're not with the "D.E.A." Throw this guy out. No, no, wait, wait. I'm not. Well, who are you then? This is my wife, you son-of-a-bitch. You stay away from her, or I'll kill you. This is as close as you're ever going to get again. Hi, this is Amy. Sorry I can't take your call right now. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. Amy, it's Mitch. He knows about us. Call me. Would you please stop that? Are you out of your mind? She said he would kill her. That's just bitch-talk. All he's going to do is screw her brains out. You, he'll kill. Don't say anything to Ted. I'll never hear the end of it. Forget about Ted, he's not even around. He's on vacation for, like, ten days. You do know that Ted and I saw them, right? A few nights ago. Where? Some country dive that Ted likes. We were there, we saw them in this corner booth, Just hanging out by themselves. They looked fine. Are you sure it was them? Yes. In fact, the husband went for another drink, And then Ted went over there and talked to her, Started flirting with her. The night I met her, she said Ted tried to hit on her. She shot him down. What happened when they talked? I don't know. I was too far away to hear, And Ted didn't say anything about it. And five minutes later, he was hitting on another woman. No, I'm not "D.E.A." YOU Know who sent me. Stevie? Yeah, Stevie. You're here for the money. Actually, Stevie told me to tell you that, Uh, you don't owe him anything. The debt's been paid. What? Yeah. - Yeah. - Really? Yeah. It's, uh, I don't know. Hey, Johnny, get this guy a free one. No. Hey listen, I got to go, And, uh, you have a good day. Stay for a drink. * Tell me you're ready for the time of your life, * * yeah, it'll be a lifetime... Hey, Mitch! Mitch! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Man, what's wrong? - I've got to get out of here. - Come on, we'll go to the "V.I.P." No, I've got to get out this way. What is wrong, man? That, and that. Oh, no, no, no! Where you going, punk? Here, here, here. Where you going, huh? Get the other guy! That other one! Go, go! - Uh-uh-uh! - Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! All right, all right. Hey! Calm down, huh? Who's the tough guy? I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, man. We're going to beat the crap out of you and your little boyfriend over there, And then we're going to take whatever the hell we want. Right? Hey, move along, pal, this ain't none of your business. Are you deaf? I said move along! You want some of this? Holy shit! Come on! What the hell is going on, Mitch? Who is that guy? - Amy's married. - Yeah, so what? What does that... wait, that's her husband? What, you didn't see the news? Look, I've been out of town for ten days. What the hell is going on? Go, go! [Phone Rings] Hey! - You okay? - Yes. Yes, I'm okay, he just took a cab to the airport. I'm packing. Come to the back of the house. It should be open. If not, there's a key in a potted plant next to the door. Mitch, take me away from here. I'm on my way. [*] Amy? Amy? Amy! Nine-one-one, what's the nature of your emergency? Mister Harwell, I'm Detective Zyler, my partner, Detective Koduri. We've met. Right. So did you know the deceased, Ken Hannison? Met him. I wouldn't say that I know him. How'd you get the shiner? Must have been a hell of a meeting. Terrible way to die, by being... Stabbed to death. SO, you were, um, there to meet his wife? Because you claim she called you to come over. Were you having an affair? No, it's okay. It's not a crime to sleep with another guy's wife, Although it certainly could lead to one. I'm confused, are you the good cop or the bad cop? Eh, we're both bastards. Lucky me. We'll see. So, were you? Were I what? Sleeping with the deceased's wife? My partner actually said, Sleeping with the deceased's wife. I know, I have a hell of a time understanding him myself, And he shouldn't be smoking in here. You know my methods, Zyler. Yeah, being an asshole, that's your method. Jerk. Jackass. You two need a moment? No, we're good. Yeah, I know her. She's a friend. She called me. And you went over. Yes, but I didn't kill her husband, though. And could somebody explain to me how a police officer Shows up before I'm even done with my nine-one-one call? Huh? What? There's an interrogation going on in there. God damn it, I'm his... Check it out. Lady, I can't do that. Look, you let me in. Check it out. You are not allowed in there. Look who it is! Just another exciting day at the cop shop. Come on. You can go. - What was Lily doing there? - What, you knew Amy was married - and you didn't say anything to me? - Look, I assumed you knew. Right? You're the one banging her. Look, I shouldn't have assumed, I guess. He's still back there. Where are we going, anyway? Redmond. Why? I don't know. Amy Hannison said that you two met at a bar And that you've been stalking her ever since. And the number that you claim is hers? - It's to a pre-paid phone. - Am I in some kind of trouble? Calling nine-one-one saved your ass for now. What do you mean? I mean, if you just murdered someone, Why stick around and call the police? Yeah, what were the cops doing there, by the way? The Hannisons were under occasional surveillance. They're suspected of shipping cars with guns In them to the Mexican drug cartel. I'm working the case with Zyler and Koduri. They're going to want to investigate you now. Are they going to find anything? Nope. Really? You want to tell me about Kevin Burke? You digging into my life now? Look, if I'm to help you, I can't be surprised. He was a friend. Yeah, a friend you shot and killed two years ago While hunting in Redmond. And he was a cop. And you don't trust cops, do you? Well, with the way that his cop friends made my life miserable, No, I don't. There were a couple of cases I worked on where police planted evidence, so I understand... What are you talking about, the occasional surveillance? Zyler and Koduri didn't need it continuously, They have somebody working under cover. And although I'm on the team, they won't tell me who. Need a ride home? Yeah. Okay. [*] Bring back some memories? Oh my God. We haven't seen this place in years. Yeah. Used to be a fun place to hide when we were kids, huh? It's completely rusted over! This whole thing! Yeah. It's like the town's graveyard. She tried to have me kill her husband, But I wouldn't take the bait. So she killed him and framed you? No, she had somebody else kill him and they framed me. You say you and Ted saw her at a bar with her husband And they were all cozy. Yeah. Was it him? Where'd you get this? Was it him? No, it was someone else. The person you saw her with was her real love. I'm the fall guy. So what are we going to do? Hannison had some pictures taken of us. If I could get my hands on them, I could prove she's lying. So tell the police. Okay, so how do we get them? We break into her house and find them. How are we going to do that, Mitch? I know where she hides they key. She lied to you about me and her. What do you mean? Look, she didn't shoot me down that night. She was all over me. Yeah, this is starting to make sense. Look, we're at a bar, she's drunk. She starts bragging about how she's going to leave her husband, right? How she siphoned off, like, eight hundred thousand dollars From different accounts, has it all stashed in some locker Somewhere, which she says is completely untraceable. She even showed me a key. A blue key? Yeah. You don't think this is true, do you? I did see a blue key. Well, don't feel bad, man. It could have happened to anybody. It could have happened to me. Eh, you're smart enough to not let it happen to you. We're going in. Call me if she comes back. Are you really going to break in? [Phone rings] Yeah? A truck just pulled into the driveway. I think it's the groundskeeper or something. All right, no problem. [Phone Rings] Yeah. You in? Yeah, no problem. Listen, I'm a little busy, man. [Phone Rings] Yeah. Look, this is ridiculous. It's going to take me forever to search this place. And that's assuming that they're even here. Come on, let's just get out of here. All right. I'm coming out the front. Come on, come on! How screwed am I? Amy just pulled in. Someone's with her. I found these the morning after. He was paranoid all right. Can't really blame him. Shut up. I'll get it. Do you think the police have seen these? No. They would have been confiscated. I'll get rid of them. Ah, that's okay. I can do it. [Phone Rings] I need to take this. Okay. Hi. Yeah. All right, hurry up. I can't talk. Yes, just, can you please just do it tonight? Okay. I got to, I got to, I've got to go. Okay, bye. Do they suspect anything? You worry a lot. Do they? No. They think Harwell killed Ken. We're in the clear. Okay, I'll drive you back. Don't you remember? We had fun once. [Moaning] When this is over, we go our separate ways. After we split the life insurance, as planned. Never forget. You traded yourself for your freedom. Rick. [*] Do they suspect anything? You worry a lot. Do they? No. They think Harwell killed Ken. We're in the clear. You got them. You got them both. Right. Here's your copy. You've still got it on your phone and, Uh, it's backed up here. You going to the police? I'm going to call my attorney first. Never forget, you traded yourself for your freedom. What you guys did here was really dangerous, Not to mention illegal. It's still evidence. Who is this guy? He looks familiar to me, but I can't place him. I probably defended him in a petty crime once, And got the asshole off. That would be ironic, wouldn't it? You have another copy of this? Let's go. I'm just going to stay here. Police stations are kind of depressing. Detective Zyler will see you shortly. Hi. Yeah. All right, hurry up. I can't talk. Yes, just, can you please just do it tonight? Okay. I got to, I got to, I've got to go. Okay, bye. Um, there's a detective here I'd like to speak to for a minute about a case. - You all right? - Yeah. [Phone Ring] Yeah? You know, I was just watching the recording. I hope you don't mind. No, why? It's just, you know, Mitch, Sometimes we fixate on how we think we know things, Only to learn we're wrong. The fact is, we couldn't see it, Because we were so focused on what we thought was true. I cleaned up the audio. You're not going to believe this. Oh hey, listen, man, I've got to go. Right. Bye. Hi. I'm Detective Rick Larker. Detective Zyler is unavailable, So what can I do for you, Mister Harwell? Your a cop? So I was told you have some evidence on the Hannison murder investigation. May I see it? Is it on that flash drive? You're a murder suspect, so give that to me. It's not going to do you any good. I made copies and I gave them to my friend. Uh-huh. Is that your friend Simon? What, are you surprised? I know all about you and your, your friends. Do you really think that you have something on me? I mean, really? Because you're on my turf, And you don't fight a dragon in its own backyard. Uh, thanks, Detective Larker. I really appreciate. I will get right on that right now, and hey! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! You look great for 28! I didn't know it was your birthday. Happy Birthday, you old bastard! Hey, Happy Birthday, man. Harwell knows. He has evidence against us. No, no. I know where he's going, so here's what I need you to do. Come on, come on. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. - Yeah. - Hey! Get out of there right now. He knows you're there! He knows exactly what we're doing! Just get out of there! Don't ask any questions. Just go! Well, slow down, slow down. What? Simon? Simon? Simon! Simon's dead. You're next. Move. I don't want my car to be seen. Take it, and get out of here. Everything is falling apart, okay? Here's what I need you to do. - Mitch. - Lily! He's a cop! The killer is a cop. He just killed Simon! Calm down, Mitch. You need to tell us where you are. - Us? - Hold on. Mitch. Yeah? It's Detective Zyler. Where are you heading? We'll meet you there. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Trust me. Holy crap! It seems like everybody's involved. Seems that way. I think there's another car behind us. Yeah, I noticed that too. Any idea who it could be? Nope. I can't believe that about Simon. It's my fault. I didn't get to him in time. How did you wreck your car? That's how I ended up at the club. Take the next exit. Come on. Come on! Hey, where are we going? Just follow me. Park in the lot and stay here. Okay, split up. Find a place to hide. It's over, Mitch. You don't have a weapon or a badge. Mitch? Mitch? He had evidence against Ken and me. He was a cop. What was I supposed to do? He used me, I used him, and I'm really sorry that, I'm really sorry that I got you involved in this. I was in your room... When you made love to him. Made love to him? I didn't make love to him, he forced himself on me. He was raping me. Stop, Just stop. The guy that I shot, The guy I killed, it wasn't an accident, It was self-defense, just like you. He wanted me out of the picture, And just like you, he tried to kill me. Amy, I need you to call an ambulance. I cannot go to prison. Amy, please, I'm dying. Please call somebody. I cannot go to prison! Amy, no. Amy, don't. Please, don't do this. Where's Ted? Amy! What? She was going to kill you? You didn't say you had a gun. Yeah, that was selfish of me. Now look, Mitch, I know you think you loved her, That you two had a thing, But remember I knew her too. She was bad news. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but... Looking for this? You just so happened to be at the club? She just happens to know my favorite book? They could be coincidences, But you let me get shot! You set me up, didn't you? Didn't you? She paid me to find a fall guy. It was nothing personal. She also promised to pay me to take care of Rick there, But that's obviously not going to be a problem. What is that thing you said, about the truth, how it's hard? - Hi. - Is Rick on to you? Yeah, uh, hurry up. - I can't talk. - Do you have the money? Yes, can you just please do it tonight? Unbelievable. All this unnecessary trouble, And unbeknownst to Mitch, Simon posted it to the Internet before he died. - 50,000 hits. - Yeah, and climbing. Uh, I'm sorry, Lily, but this is a crime scene. You need to police your own people better. You were supposed to stop her. Some cop you are. You know, why don't you make yourself useful And grab me a coffee, jackass? Can you give us minute? What happened? What's this? It's a key to a locker with a lot of money in it. Where'd you get it from? Amy. I'll take care of it. If you ever decide to become a real attorney, Now would be a good time. I'm going to need one. I'm going to go handle this and then I'll come see you, okay? Okay.
