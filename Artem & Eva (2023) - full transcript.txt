These here are the vibrators, yes? Yes, vibrators. These here are hard, right? Yes. This one here is longer and thinner. Do you recommend it? - Yes, longer and thinner. I think this one works better. One of these two there. With this one the testicles are better made. They look more realistic. They are similar But only this one has an ejaculation function. Let's take this one? Hello! Who needs a willie? I'm selling willies. Stop it. - 1000 rubles, unused. Stop it. My mom would be so proud of me. Your voice must ... I don't know ... How do I explain it ... Soft, playful, half-whispering, not loud. Do you understand? You say "Hi." Grab the dick. Just like how you meet people. Then you say something like ... You take a look at it ... And first you say: "Hi." Such a big dick. Hello. ... Speak louder. Hello. "Such a big dick you have", should be written there. "Dick" was missing. Just say: "Such a big dick." Hi. Wow, such a big dick. Come on my face. My eyes. You know, that you won't be able to lead a normal life anymore? That this is a life in the abyss. I said to Slava yesterday: "If I have to work five days a week in an office, I will go crazy." Terrible. You and your irony. But again: In a normal society - not in a marginal and dirty one - this is taboo. And we live in such a society? So we belong to the people that forbid things from each other? I want to bite you. No one is watching our videos. What do you mean no one. We are at 28,000. And here 15,000. 15,000. JOURNALISM DISTANCE EDUCATION I want to come to Omsk earlier. If only there weren't lectures ... It's beautiful here in Moscow. One can go out. But we are at home. In Omsk we'd also have to sit at home. We've bought the tickets. We are coming. We take off at 23:15 and on the 29th at 5 AM we'll arrive. How far did you collect them? - I got all the way to the corner. But only at arm level? - No, also the lower ... You can help us with the potatoes. What a great image Julia on the potato field But you have to show her where the potatoes are. I know where they are. and what they look like. - Really? You are capable to leave only the weeds standing. My darling dogs ... Weeding is fine, but I can't remove insects. I've wiped them out. Gina! Give her a raspberry. Really? - She also eats raspberries. What's wrong Gina? What's outside? Everything ok? Everything fine outside? Why are you panting like that? Where were you? Give me your paw. Give me your paw. You are a big cat. Not a dog, a cat. Good girl. Stand up. Up. Stand up. Good girl. Do you want a raspberry? Stand still! Stand. Here, a raspberry. And about Spiderman. I like it better than the one from yesterday. It's like when you sleep with a girl, and you come on your hand and do this. First everyone is saying: "Yuck, they are making porn." But when I post a story on Instagram how Artem gifted me an iPhone XS, that costs 100,000 rubles, like on Women's Day ... Then everyone says "Damn, they earn so much money?" Of course we earn a lot of money but no one knows that because we're not showing it off. One does not salute them. But one would not do something like that themselves. And they are doing it! And one thinks "How can that work?" I don't know if I should say this, but we experienced Artem as very shy and reserved. And suddenly he's making porn! Many people don't understand porn stars. "How can you show yourself like that?" True, I agree with you. But the wish to watch it is still there. And I don't find that okay. This conservative way, how we've been raised ... I'm not saying that it is bad, I'm not saying that ... Do you want to get wasted? - I want to drink. But not that. All of that is alcohol-free. Julia is sitting there and could explode from her energy. Yes! - She has to get rid of it. I don't get to party in Moscow. Two years without partying is hard. Something is bottled up. - Yes. You would have to literally tear down the dacha. Take two drinks bottoms-up. - Come on, I am fine. Alissa is already drunk. She wants to fight. Shall we fight? - Let's go to the village ... If we fight I'll throw up. - So you've lost. I used the situation, the patriarchy has been downed. You defeated the patriarchy. The patriarchy is defeated. The matriarchy has won. Or are you for the centrists? For the slavophiles. Should we get some ice cream? - I am an Old Ritualist. Do you really want to go somewhere now? I'm not moving a meter. I'd go to the lake - It'll be an adventure! And adventures are fun. I'm for the lake - It'll be cool for sure. It'll be fun. My hair is wet, nothing matters to me anymore. You're surely already sick. Are we going to the sauna? Are we going to the sauna? Amazing! This warms from the inside, Alissa. I'm not cold, but I won't say no to something like this. GROCERIES Let's play a game. What game? - Bet who will throw up first. What a pretty dog. Surely not me - I bet Danil. He is so strong. If I don't smoke, I won't throw up for sure. Today I see you for the third time in my life and two from three times you've thrown up. So, statistically ... Wait, we've seen each other before? Who provoked whom? Artem, what do you say? I bet that Danil will throw up. The dachas seem gloomy. A bad area. Are you concerned about the area or the people around you? Does the the area sadden you? No, it's only ... near here I have spent a lot of time in such dachas. And to only have running water three times a day, planting potatoes to keep busy ... We've been here two days already. And now? Now I'm tired. If you're tired, we can also go. No. - Nothing is stopping us. I will just lie down on the grass. Okay. Had he known, he would not have come. I believe that too. Artem is no partying type. Artem, damn it! Danil is one. A cockatoo. A pterosaur in human form. She works during the day. Alissa! They are probably making out upstairs. Don't you want to go upstairs with Artem? To warm them up? Artem is no longer here. He left? - Yes, he left. Damn, Artem is gone? - Yes. And why? He wanted to go home. Alissa! Ready, on three. One, two, three. Alissa! Everything okay? - Yes. Of course. Fuck you. Why is there no music? Is someone playing music? I'm on it. LAW UNIVERSITY OF MOSCOW Nicotine is not questioned. Everything is the way it should be. Please. Now it burns. When you breathe in, open your mouth. Respect, that you sent everyone packing. That you told everyone on Instagram: "Piss off!" Very directly. You are just people, that have this something. Our life situation forced us to it. I already know what I will say: "Papa, damn it, I'm so sorry. I am not a hostage of your ambition. I have my own plans." One should not be like everyone else. Be original and not a good copy. Seriously, they've already planned my life. They have funny ideas. Going in direction of: "The children have moved to Moscow, They work there and study." They still believe that I'm struggling here, and that I moved to Lyubertsy, because I have no money. And I can't manage to say: "Papa ..." Sometimes I would love to, but it would be shitty of me. Open your jaw, to create a vacuum. How? Like that! Should I do it like that? - No. Just like that, open your jaw and breathe in. I'm scared. Come on. I am just drunk. I'm scared. Watch your head. - You still walk straight. Maybe we should not risk it? I'm just moving it to the side, so we have room. Turn it around. Don't put it on the ground. Like that is good. Let's fuck? Bite your lip. A bit more erotic. I don't have big lips to bite. Not like that ... So then ... I can bite the top one. No, don't do that. Water is coming out. Okay. - What did you do? I drew arrows. Did you only write "slut"? No, there are also arrows. We could write "bitch". Yes, we could, right. Across here. Or better here. On the butt. like a tattoo. It's exciting. That stays the whole life. My dick needs to get hard. Let's make out. We could reply to the email. There are also other unanswered ones there. Can you read that out for me? We should not reply to that one. What does he want? "I am looking for 3 models for an erotic mafia film." I don't know, what the "H" is supposed to mean. "I have two models from Czechia and I'm looking for another one. It will be filmed on my farm 100 kilometer from Warsaw." That's bullshit. They'll tie you up, and then you're screwed. "In a little European village, in a dark forest ... lust turns into a demonic shape ... Lust turns into a demonic shape ... And the evil, destructive monster is let loose in the city ... in the shape of a beautiful, successful woman." At least then I would be playing the main character in a movie. You see, I have the soul of an actress. I never made it to theater, but I grab on to every chance, to be an actress. Damn it, that is something like ... "Phantom Seducer". It's not professional to ask about the pay. He has to say his rate. You understand? We never worked like that before. We'd be paid for the entire day. Usually they pay per scene. We should have written 500 euro. 500 euro? - For the day. He wrote "Three hours or a day". 500 is probably too much. What's there to see for 500 euro? A man says to his wife: "That was wild, we robbed a pharmacy. I stole condoms with different flavours. Let's go, I'll turn the lights off, and you try to guess the flavour." He turns the lights off. She goes ... "Beer cheese?" "Wait, damn it, I don't have anything on it yet." Beer cheese. Squeeze them together. Just like that! Super! Stay like that. Yes, just like that. Great. Move the hair from your face. Good like that. Tongue! One could sell the lollypop to a fan. You can take it and sell it, if you want. Pull closer! Just like that! Lie down. Will you tuck me in? - Yes. Like a mom. - Of course. Like mom. I'll cover your willie. Just like that. Thank you. Then you'll come here and say: "Hey, wake up, step-bro. I don't have any panties on." And then you'll start. Should I look at him during? - Look into the camera. Like that. A bit higher and on the cheek. As if you wanted to show, how big his dick is, and how small your head. As if you're trying to make a phone call with his dick. Excuse me, madam. I'm taking advantage of my position. Take advantage. No touching! Don't make Artem angry. I'm going to grab the dick now. No, don't do that. Does that work? Well ... Look this way. Here. Squeeze your tits together. Don't furrow your eyebrows. Look here. Perfect, hold it. Pay attention to the brow. And look this way. I feel very unwell with him. I can't even say, what exactly I don't like. I surely can't tell him: "It is awful, to film such crap." I don't want this nonsense, that's for sure. Well ... This part of the job I enjoy the least. That's for sure. Particularly here. It's so ... Actual porn is filmed here. I had to balance myself on a chair, make a salto and then land in the vagina. We didn't do anything out of the ordinary. At home we also fuck like that. No. - Yes. We do doggy style, sideways, I'm on top, from behind .. The first one was nonsense. The first one we do only in bed. I'm not at the end of the bed, but lift my legs up. Yeah ... - It's all in your head. it was not physically unpleasant, because everything was actually comfortable. And now you're furrowing your brows again. You also do that in front of the camera. You're overthinking about something. Yeah. You have to relax more. And brood less? - Yeah, try it. The tea was for you, and I've almost drunk it all. Here, it's cold already. The tea bag is still swimming inside. Not here, that'll drip on the couch. Should I put it back? - Yes, that'd be the best. What? You're torturing me. First it should be out, and then back in. You see, yet again ... You don't deliberate enough. You need to think more. Also true. I'll just say: "Papa, I'm not a lawyer any more. We shoot porn now." Who, you? I've worked as a lawyer. He thinks I'm still doing that. Wait a minute, you're a lawyer? - Yeah. And I'm an astronaut, damn it. You've never experienced me in court. I have always won. I was always in a shirt and with short hair. What a facial expression. That's going to be a shock therapy. Why shock therapy? You're the one fucking, and not the one getting fucked. Your father will say: "Sonny, amazing, congrats!" No, for him that'll be a shock. If he then tells you, that you should not be with a girl like that, call me. I'll pick her up in Moscow. She is good. You say: "What a mess." "Step-bro ..." - Step-bro again? Of course, damn it. It's always the step-brother. - Really? Yeah. - Why? Because he can't be your father. Maybe my boyfriend or classmate? Not interesting. We're making an incest movie. I just need a minute, then I'll be ready to go. I'll go for a smoke. - Okay. I can jump in, if you want ... Was the position uncomfortable or ... Or what? Or can you not come, because that doesn't excite you? Should we go up to the castle? Is he real? - Yeah, the real Iron Man. Tony Stark. The real one ... - Why is he collecting money? Maybe the suit is made out of scrap parts. And he's going to fly away suddenly. So, that's a very different side of Prague. We don't know, in what category I'm nominated in? It doesn't say. Lower. Damn it. Read it! "Hello Eva, you are nominated for the Pornhub Awards 2019. We are looking forward to celebrate your success this year, in the big Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. We hope to be able to welcome you on October 11 We can offer you financial support for the trip to Los Angeles." As soon as we're back, we need to apply for a visa. Damn, that's just ... If we go there ... then ... it'll open many new doors. Damn ... It is hard to grasp what an opportunity this is. Very awesome. A dream. I have to deregister from university. Why? No, but ... Damn ... We have to register, to be able to travel as a married couple. To apply? - Yeah. There's no time for that. There's an emergency application. You'd have to be pregnant, it's faster for pregnant people. I don't want to be pregnant. You'll get pregnant ... and then get an abortion. What a tactic to get to L.A. We applied for student visas. They didn't ask, amd we had our student IDs with us. Yes, we said that we're students. In our passports there are many European trips registered. Yes. No, so, we ... we work in the porn industry and have to go the Oscar ceremony. The invitation came per email, but it is not official. We said as much and showed them our work. Her colleague looked at us funny and then declined us. Should we lie and say we're travelling as tourists? I don't want to lie ... We could test it with your parents. You are such a coward. - Why? If my parents find out, then yours too. I'm certain, if we tell it like it is, ... Damn, I'm certain. If you say: "Mom, I shoot porn." Then she's going to say: "Fucking shit." Maybe she'll also say, that we shouldn't tell my parents. So, why tell them at all? We shouldn't say that we shoot porn. But? - But ... "I work as an erotic model. That is all." I don't know how your family feels about it, but in my family that might not end well. So not horrible, but... I don't know. That could ruin our trip. The typical sound of the USA. Simply gorgeous. Here you have the feeling you're walking through a movie. Simply surreal. - No ... I don't know. There are so many ... games und films, that take place in this scenery. I understand why Andrey said, that this here is just a dream. When you immerse yourself in this Western culture, you get the feeling that you're home. And that's how it has to be. I don't like all the dirt here. Yeah, I can't also ... I can't also say, why I like it here, I just like it very much. Where you from? - From Russia. Dawai, dawai, harasho. A lot of people from Russia like do this. What day is it today in Russia? Saturday? - Probably. So we're relaxing today. How is the weather in Moscow? - Be quiet. Why should I be quiet? Hello. The connection is poor. Artem, hello. - Hello. Are you guys at home? Are you resting? - Yes. Tell me please, that everything is fine with you both. The other problems are more than enough. Are there by any chance cheap tickets to Omsk? Don't you want to fly to us? This is not possible. Maybe after new year, because now for me the exams are starting. For Artem too. Then it's the new year already. Didn't you go to the hairdresser? - Yeah I went. That's why you don't turn on the camera. No, not because of that. Ok fine. Get some rest and good night. Kisses to you both. - Good night. Good night, Julia. How could I have said that we are in the USA? You should have said that straight away. I didn't say anything She talks all the time, and I am silent. Pornhub ... Pornhub has 120 million visits ... a day. I just want to say thank you to Courtney my manager, my friends Doug, James and Louis, who are all watching at home. And you all have ... Most popular verified amateur And the winner goes to ... LeoLulu! Thank you, thank you guys so much! When we uploaded the first video, we never expected to be here two years after. What's up? Artem, please place that ring on Julia's ring finger. Yes. - And please repeat after me: With this ring, I marry you. I promise to love you, forever. Thank you, Artem. And give Julia a kiss on the hand. Julia, it's your turn Put it on me. Place that ring on Artem's ring finger. and please repeat after me With this ring ... Repeat. ... I marry you. I promise to love you, forever. Thank you. And give Artem a big kiss on the cheek. How long you been together? - For two years already. You've been together for two years. I want you to look into each other's eyes. Is there anything you want to say to each other? Right now, you can say it in any language you want. Well then, congratulations. Congratulations. I love you. - I love you too. By the power vested in me, by the great state of Nevada, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Artem,you may kiss your bride. I don't know how we should film it. You don't like it? Well this here looks like Chelyabinsk, almost. Is it too barren for you? As someone who likes to film, who gets excited ... about things, I'm against it. Screw it, let's go. Too bad. But it doesn't look bad. In a porn film it's not about the view. Then we should do it the way you like, monotonous shit in rental apartments, that you see only in porn movies. I didn't dream of this, damn it. I think that the sounds of the powerful ocean is more important. It's cool isn't it. But you can't see anything. What's there to see? - Some sort of background. Wait, let's see. Stop it, I'm falling. That was my aim. Restaurant? Hello. Yeah, yeah. As if you could make a call. I asked you to take your backpack with you. You have your own. The car is too far away, I'm not going back. If you keep grumbling, I'll go back after all. 40 minutes. We're getting our drink bottles. Wait here, damn it, until you're back here! Are you mad? I'm used to your hysterical fits, so no. Should I tell you something? - Go for it. The relationship between two people is ideally symbiotic. Each is responsible for the other, and both share the duties equally. And if, as is usually the case, it's not a symbiosis, the one who does less compensates, usually with love, tenderness or warmth. Do you want me to stop you and say, "Artem, no!" No, I just realized that I've had enough. It's as if everything revolves around what Julia wants. Does she want this or that? And I am at your service. And then I judge you for it and I can't behave normally towards you. It's not like that. No? No idea. At least that's how I feel about it. During this trip we're doing what you want. We fulfill your desires. I love you. I love you too. Let's go. I want to kiss you there. Still, you are and remain a bitch. And you still have expectations and you are annoyed when they are not fulfilled. Of course I have expectations. - That's exactly how children behave. You act like a child. Do you want to go all the way to the top? I would be for over there. Here there are something like steps. How do we get back down after this? Artem, no, please no. I'm scared. You know I'm afraid of heights. Your generation sucks, damn it. Egoists and idiots. "We don't owe anyone anything." Damn, who tolerates people like that? We don't owe anyone anything. Tolerate, not owe. Nobody tolerates you, that's the whole point. A generation of lone wolves. And this from the greatest lone wolf of them all? It's not about whether I owe you anything. But I repeat myself for three days already, that I am tired of hearing allegations every day, that I am to blame for something. It's just a joke. I just don't find it funny anymore. It's driving me crazy slowly. Good. Do we want to do it mostly from behind? You can sit like this, and I'll give you a blowjob. We have already filmed sideways. We can also do it this way, if we drive slowly. Stop it. A car will drive by for sure. We can't do that. This is slowly turning into work. Like an office job That's what exactly this is now. Let's drive and maybe shoot something later? No. What is more important to you: our shoot or your state of mind? I don't know. Later I will probably probably feel like shit. And have no desire for it. Do you feel like it now? - No, not now either. If you don't care about anything, we can film now. I don't want it any more. I can't go on with it. Because the hobby, that was fun and made money, has become torture. This will be a very long conversation. Conversation? That's just my feeling. What? - It's not supposed to be a conversation. This is affecting our relationship. And that is bad. I thought it would be different. But it isn't. But it could have been. And what is your suggestion? How should it continue? I don't know. We should do something else. Edik, look. May I congratulate you? Here is mine. This is... The ring from water bottles. What are you talking about? This is minimalism. You don't know a thing about it, damn it. Congratulations. When should everything take place? We got married in Las Vegas. Really? Is that official? - Yes. Is it registered in the passports? We need to transfer the document at the notary public. Then you get the stamp? - Your ash. Damn it. We were in such a great place. Sunset under palm trees, advertising signs, Las Vegas. Looks like in the commercials. - Yeah. How long were you there? Three weeks. Really awesome. We were four days in Los Angeles. The best thing would be to stay there. You can see every day my body. Swipe up my premium Snapchat. Every day My boobs and my ass and my pussy. You have reached your destination. Here? - Yes. Hello. "The fire salamander eats them up. It eats my colony. It eats up the larvae, and inside me there is a gaping void. The toothpick is your cross. Winter is around the corner. In the anthill it's getting stuffy. The oddball hangs on the cross. Running away would be good. But the emptiness of the ants fills with pheromones and with formic acid. The ant architects ..." According to statistics there are more married women than men. Do some men have several wives? Women who live with their boyfriend, believe that they are married. Men do not believe that. And married men believe they are still bachelors, don't they? Even if there is a stamp in the passport. Nobody looks in the passport. You both are so quiet. Maybe because they have to leave soon. As if, they think about nothing else. Make a wish for a song. Artem will play and sing it. Artem, we wish for a song. About the grasshopper or the boy who chases lightning. Grasshopper? - You will hear. Artem, which grasshopper? The one from your childhood? "In the grass sits a grasshopper ..." Ant. - Ah, an ant! There is also a song about a grasshopper. Ant. - From his childhood. There is also one about a boy who chases lightning. About love. I am worried, because he has to leave the guitar here. Why? - Why? He will not. Are you afraid, that I will do something to it? No, he can't be without it. At what age did you become interested in porn? I did not think about the porn industry. Not at all. But in my circle of friends I was always the most vulgar. And it was always said: "Why are you so vulgar? What's wrong with you?" So, some think of something inappropriate. And I speak it out. Then I get to hear: "We're thinking about it, And you speak it out." That's the way it was always. I was the girl that the boys liked, at school. I have always had this sexual attention. I have never taken advantage of it. I did not have sex with boys, who I wasn't dating. I was faithful to my boyfriends. But I always wanted to to take erotic photos. I did that already in Omsk, first photo shoots. Around how old were you? At your first shoot? When you thought, "I'm going to do this." For this the photographer will end up behind bars. No one will learn his name. I was probably around 15 or 16. You always shoot with the same partner. I know that you don't shoot with others. Aren't you afraid that this will stop you, to become famous worldwide? That is not my goal at all. We have discussed all this beforehand. I do not want to shoot with other men. That doesn't appeal to me at all. Ideally I would also make lesbian films. What percentage of the revenue goes to him? He doesn't take any of it. He walks around in torn shoes, never buys new clothes. I get all the money. Don't you have a ... - Revenue sharing? So maybe no contract, but something legally binding? - No. You could leave him and he would be left with nothing? Yes, probably. Are you ready? I have already packed everything. Yes, so all this has to come. These are clothes: My jackets and so on. The microwave, this bag ... the cardboard box under your suitcase ... and the bag, too. All that now? - Yeah. This morning I said: "Write Veronika, so that she doesn't travel all the way here." You said: "Yes, I forgot." No, you didn't! You said, she should come in the evening, about nine or ten. Why are you lying now? I did not say that. - You did, damn it! That's what you told me today. - What do you want from me? Nothing, but this is just shit. Because now I have to pack all night. You will not help me, Artem. You won't pack anything, but I will! You say that as if I never do anything. Okay ... She's going to visit us anyway. I don't give a damn. - Well then ... Your mood is really funny. You could be bipolar. Huh? - How else do you explain it? I beg you, don't say something like that. Artem, tell me, what's wrong with you? Why do you say such a thing? That's disrespectful. Do you understand nothing of this? Or what? Sick. Calm down. Terrible ... Unbelievable, Artem! You come at me because of some shit. Why? Because I have to pack all night long? When I ask you, you refuse my help. And now you say, that you are struggling. You have the victim syndrome: "I'm suffering, and you're not doing anything." What is this nonsense? What is this? Do you think this is normal? I would like you to better yourself. This is the meaning ... The meaning of life. I am not your student! Yes, you are! - What the hell are you talking about? I am your beloved. You must see me like this. When two people meet, they both learn from each other. Yes, but not like this: "Now learn this!" How else? Be a little smarter and wiser. What do you mean, "wiser"? Wait a minute. I don't understand ... We have only moved out of the apartment. Things are changing with you so radically. Terrible. Terrible? These are good changes. We're finally moving out of there. We have an apartment in the center. What is terrible about that? What are you going to live on? We still have money, that will last for a while. Don't make a drama out of it now. Everything is great. So I can see, who would like to present point 1 Write "Number 1" and your last name. This is a lecture with presentation. Please write a little faster. I don't have much time, and everyone must participate. "Dear Eva, I am a fan of your work. When I see you I feel the strong desire to take you. You are so beautiful. I want to meet you. Of course, time is money. Write me." There are billions of such messages. As always, a dick pic. What do you call this crisis, when you do not know, what to do? If you don't know? - It starts with E. Existential? - Yes! Again? - Existential. A? - Existential! Existential. Am I disturbing you? - Yes, a little bit. Female clip artist of the year Wow, so many beautiful ladies there. And the winner is ... none other than the beautiful ... Eva Elfie. Thank you so much guys, who always vote for me every day. Thank you for my fans and thank you Xbiz. I am very happy to win. Beautiful, thank you very much. Now please just stand by for one second. What is going on here? I missed everything. THE MAN'S WAY TO PORN-STARDOM One doesn't believe that it's you. Even here. I don't know if it's the make-up or the curls. I always look different. I wanted to go to the theater or become an actress. I like to transform myself, through clothes or a different look. These are the clicks? - Yes, 165 million clicks. And how long have you been doing this? Not even a year. In February it will be a year. It is indeed a city of millions, but it is like a village. Where I live there is not even internet. There are no roads and no cab goes there either. I see. It is quite a poor town. My mother earns about 200 euros. Where does she work? - In an old people's home. She even has a small management position. She earns 200 euros? That's ... 15,000 rubles. She has one boyfriend and one girlfriend. And I'm like ... the most important of all. Today I met a Russian girl. She is a porn actress and she has a husband and she has children. But she always fucks all these guys. I do not understand why. So crazy girl. This is different. This is "libertinage." That's when you have a strong relationship with someone. And then you can ... But she likes to fuck guys anally. You mean "anal"? - Yes. But she fucks the guys, no guys fuck her. Do you understand? - Ah, she fucks the guys. With a strap-on! I like this idea ... Well, I will start with the first question, lex mercatoria. We should probably start with the fact that, that in the current judicature it's not yet been clarified to the end, What is lex mercatoria. There are three approaches: The first one is, that lex mercatoria is seen as a completely autonomous legal system, which does not depend on any national legal system. The second approach states, that lex mercatoria is a composition of certain norms, which exists alternatively to a state order. I am now 19. Too young to think about children. Slowly I'm learning which subjects I like, and which ones I don't. When I was 17 I took the entrance examination for law, because my parents said I had to become a lawyer. And I was thinking: "They're right." That was not my choice. I can not call it a choice. I think ... that it went like this for very many people. That is not too bad, because some remain with it. They remain behind in their development. You said it. Is there something wrong with my intellect? No. Probably not, I don't know. But surely with your world view. She believes that the whole world revolves around her. It is hard to describe. But if we ever have to queue somewhere, she just goes ahead. Then I ask her: "Why do you do that?" Or if we do car-sharing ... I use the car considerately, because it is also used by other people. I understand that I am not alone in this world. And I am respectful to others. She is not. She is only thinking about her needs at that moment. Or that she is doing well. You dispute everything, so you're not understanding it. The society is ... Even now you put yourself above everyone else. It is not for you to decide, what egoism and respect are. You always tell people: "You're wrong. You don't understand me." You hold that against Julia all the time, probably against everybody else, too. You are a damned sexist. You keep saying: "Women this, women that". I have not yet met a woman who ... There are super women, but mostly they are older. And one rarely meets them. Girls talk mostly just bullshit, which they themselves do not understand. They confuse even right and left. Asshole! And you supposedly never do strange things? things that are untypical for most people? I am sure, when you talk to others, they will also say: "He is strange, something is wrong with him. Such a poor guy." You talk exactly like this about ... Why you are strange? No, what has that got to do with it? I am exaggerating now, because you say "You girls don't understand anything." In the same way, someone could say, that you have no idea. "Look, he shoots porn." Does it upset you, that I am sexist? That was just a joke. I respect women, their rights and everything. And I believe that women are often dealt with unfairly. Men often behave as if women belong to them. Really wild, my mom appreciates what you do. She said: "Cool, that's brave." And then she asked: "Are they happy?" "I don't know." She said: "If they are, great." Although my mom is actually super conservative. Are you guys happy? Kiss each other. Just doing your own thing. I think, that is the true way. And what do you want? I want to live, not fight for survival. Just live, damn it, and enjoy life. I don't spend much, but I live. How do you come up with "spend"? Because I think that everything is about money. If you have money, you can live, afford everything. - No ... Without money you fight for survival. It's not about ... But even without money one can live. It is not about money! Just to live, damn it. To feel that you are needed ... That you have someone you don't feel indifferent about, that someone is not indifferent towards you. This human something in us is very strong. When someone holds on to you, simply because you exist. This is very strong. When you are appreciated, simply because you exist. Damn, that's priceless. There isn't even a porn happening in my life. Are you in a bad mood? - No. I feel unwell. When I was alone, it was fine. It is not worth talking about. But I see that you feel unwell. And I am trying to understand why, how I can help and what I should do. You shouldn't do anything. Nothing. Sooner or later everything changes. It comes to a logical end. Even if ... - But I ... I don't want it to end badly for us. You seem apathetic about everything. Where are you going? Why do you jump to conclusions? I just felt comfortable alone. We could also live separately. No ... That would probably not make much sense. But you would feel better. I don't know. I can't say whether I would then feel better or worse. You know it. We lived together. What do you mean, you don't know. I don't know ... I don't know, what you want to talk about. I suggest just to keep going and live on as before To follow the plans that we have made. That's all.
