This is where it all started... There in that car... ...just another day on the job. - Thanks. - Any word from the precinct? Yes, the victim died. Grand theft homicide, huh? Inspector Jonouchi's star sure is rising. I'm a recovering TV addict. I took this job to get clean, and get out of the house. Are you sure Usami's really in there? Huh? We got a good lead, a kid... ...which doesn't free us from having to pound some pavement. Hey, who are you rooting for? - What? - Baseball, of course. No one... The woman is back. Let's welcome her home. Excuse me, this is the police. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Drop your gun! I'm not carrying one. I'm serious. You can see for yourself. Car 12 calling precinct, over. I have discovered suspect Usami in Onomachi, fourth district. He's got one female hostage and he's armed. Detective Abukawa is negotiating with him now. Please send back up immediately, over. Shit! Fucking cops! I'll show 'em! Car 12,calling precinct, over. Hostage down! Please send medical assistance, over. I remember seeing a movie the other day on TV. An elementary school kid or something, was asking his dad, "What does it mean when somebody dies?" I remember liking his dad's answer. But I don't remember what it was. Are you all right? Are you all right? This is Kasaya. I've lost Usami. A bystander's car crashed in the chase. There are two wounded civilians. I swear I didn't understand at first. Are you all right? I think it's nothing serious. The ambulance is late. Quite the bonfire... Why didn't you just leave me? Aren't you going to arrest me? You saw me, right? As I was pulling one out, I saw something spark. That's when the whole thing blew. - What do you mean "something"? - A spark of some sort, maybe a short. What about the other passenger? He was on the other side. I couldn't reach him in time. You're still here? Jonouchi is having a fit about our losing him. I've been taken off of the case for the time being. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. It's because he goes on bad leads. Nobody thought that we'd actually find Usami there. Anyway, have a seat. I'm no good at this kind of thing. We're short-handed around here. We'll be back in action soon enough. - Well... - That's right. I've got to make on the two in the accident... The one who died in the fire's name was Shiraishi. He was in real estate. The one you saved is Koichi Teranishi. He's in banking. They were on their way to look at some property when Usami leaped into the road. Neither of them is related to the Usami case. - Let's get something to eat. - Not right now, thanks. Is that so? Life is just a series of random coincidences. Kasaya. We'll get our payback. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Why wasn't I telling him about the guy in the car? Kasaya... You don't play "go" by any chance, do you? Of course not. Well, you're no fun, are you? Why don't you go pay a hospital visit to the banker you saved? Do you mind? No, I'll go. You're the one who saved his life, after all. Come in. - How are you feeling? - Well... They tell me I'll be able to leave next week. You don't need to... But I was the cause of the accident. You're also the one who saved my life. Thank you. Look, a raven. Just kidding. It was just a joke. I suppose that this is not just a social visit? Shiraishi's death was officially recorded as "accidental". I'll let myself out. What do you mean? You know that I'm a banker, right? Last year, I expropriated funds. I thought to make some money on the stock market. It didn't work out. After that, Shiraishi helped me get money for the cover-up. Then, things started to turn ugly. He started asking for pay-offs. They kept escalating. Until I was really out of cash. Next, he began making threats... ...saying that he'd ruin my sister's wedding. He told my wife... She left me. I probably had wanted to kill him for a long time. And then that accident came my way... Even though you knew I was watching. At that point, I really don't care any more. The time had come to kill him. Shiraishi's death was officially recorded as "accidental". I only came here to report that to you. Once I've been released, you'll be able to reach me via the bank. I'm sure that we have nothing further to discuss. Have a good day. A few days later, I was told that Teranishi had been released from the hospital. I felt sure that we'd never meet again. Car 21, everything as normal, over. This better be good. 36 million yen, huh? Is 30 million yen the going rate? - Excuse me? - Please sit down. You're the one who took these, right? I don't care if you do have the negatives. I don't have the money to pay for them. What are you talking about? You have a buddy on the force who shoots pictures while you pull in stooges? You're mistaken. - There's no mistaking these pictures. - I didn't take them. - Then, how do you explain these? - I had no partner there. I thought we're alone. Then, why didn't you arrest me? - It must have been you. - You're wrong. Say what you will. I'm declining your offer. Tell me the time and place of the exchange. I'll find out who's at the bottom of this. Please tell me. I was repulsed by the way he assumed that I, too, was trying to take him. Not as a cop, but because of my own pride. You stay right there. Where's the money? Who are you? - I said, "Where's the money"? - I don't have any. Be my guest, go ahead and publish them. Take the easy way out, ante up. Police! I'm arresting you on charges of blackmail. I give up. Your name. Give me your full name. Detective, this man is guilty of murder. He incinerated a man named Shiraishi. And your proof? - Here are the negatives. - Let me have them. That's enough! - Did I kill him? - He's just unconscious. These aren't the originals... The original negatives aren't here. Yuji Yasuhara... Do you know him? I don't. He's a customer at my bank. Let me go! Hand over the negatives. - I'll forget about the blackmail charge. - No way! We've got to get out of here. Hurry up! Hurry up! The thing I remember best about all of this... ...was that sound. I had flipped a switch, somewhere, inside of me. No one else could hear it... But I had, for certain. - I guess he's dead? - Perhaps. They're gonna know that it wasn't an accident. There ae marks on the roof from the struggle, things have been cleaned up... It's only a matter of time before they figure out who he is. Can you find out his identity from his cash card? The police... The police will get ahold of the negatives. After that, it should be easy. Clean your face. Yes, Kasaya speaking. Yes. Yes, so it was a murder, right? Right, I'll be there in 30 minutes. He's dead. They'd already determined it as a murder. I am to be the investigating officer. Finding the negatives should be easy now. How long will it take before we find his address? What? The cash card. Before noon tomorrow... He had that lighter gripped in his hand. - Did you find out his address? - Yeah. The film, where's the film? - Kasaya speaking. - It's me, Abukawa. We found out who the new stiff is. There was a car hidden, not far from the crime scene. We found a drivers license in it. His name is Yuji Yasuhara, he was an inspector at the Koshinjo detective agency. - I'll go to the victim's house. - No. We'll be going to the Koshinjo. Jonouchi and his people are already on the way there. Where the hell are you, anyway? In a building, not far... I'll see you in front of Koshinjo, then. All right. - Here's the address. - Okay. Let me see... Nonaka 3, number 25. Understood, see you there in 30 minutes. I don't know much about his private life... Did he say or do anything unusual recently? It doesn't matter how small... - Do you want to have a drink? - No. What am I gonna do now? I wonder. You could try detective work. - Who, me? - Yeah. - You've got his reports? - Copies, yes. I'd like to see them, if I may. Sure, there are a lot of them. Follow me. These would be the most recent... Marriage Suitability Report: Sumiko Teranishi Well, let me see... In that room, yes... No, no... Yes. Yes, I'll talk to you later. Excuse me. Yes... Family Member Suitability: Koichi Teranishi Is there a photo file? Those would be over there. - It's here, is this okay? - Yes. Are you sure that these are all of them? We've already disposed of everything older than those. - And this? - It's Yasuhara's desk. - Can I check it? - Go ahead. Aren't you going to answer? Yes. Kasaya speaking. It's me, Teranishi. Hi, it's me. Did you find the negatives? It's driving me crazy. I'm afraid that's going to be impossible. What do you mean, impossible? I'm at work right now. Why don't we talk about this tonight? Sorry about that. How about we sign for the reports and photos and prepare to get out of here? - Why don't I fix you a whiskey? - I don't want it, thanks. The negatives weren't there. Not in his home, not in his office. They haven't been turned in as evidence, nor mentioned in the reports. But we'll find them, I promise. I want to believe you, but... I mean, you're a cop... You've got to admit, Jonouchi had a point. It's still too early to tell. What do you think? - About Yasuhara's bank records? - Yeah, the irregular payments... He was scamming somebody pretty hard. He was a private dick squeezing people off of what he'd found out on the job. That's why he was eliminated. It's obvious. But... Huh? Jonouchi? That's not deduction, that's guesswork. I don't care if he did have friends in the mob, this was no yakuza hit. Not that we have supporting evidence to the contrary... Whatever it was, the killer must have eliminated the evidence by now. Now, it's down to whatever we can find out on the street... ...especially anyone related to his investigations. You want to grab some food? I could go for some yakiniku. Do you remember Koichi Teranishi? Koichi Teranishi? The guy you pulled out of the burning car? What about him? He was one of the people written up in Yasuhara's reports. His sister's getting married, and Yasuhara was checking up on all of her relatives. So? What are you getting at? I was with him the night Yasuhara was killed. I can vouch for his whereabouts. I've been seeing a lot of him since that accident. I understand. So, that's what happened. I thought that you'd been acting strange lately. I get it now. Well, good for you! It's one less thing to worry about. If you'll testify for him, then he's all right. Right? I called Teranishi. I said I had something to tell him. You're no longer a suspect. The police think that the killer must have disposed of the negatives. The police will find the negatives. Forget about it. No, they won't. I won't let them. Let's just forget about it. Shiraishi and Yasuhara got what they had coming for them, but you're different. I couldn't stand seeing you take the rap for all of this. Besides, I'm your accomplice. Maybe we should run away somewhere together. I don't care what I have to do. I'm not letting you go down. - Long time no see. - Have a seat. Sorry to pull you away from work. It's okay, I was just getting back from a delivery. How have you been? I heard that you had a kid now. Yes, he's six months old already. It's all because you let me go that time. - Are you still tied up with the mob? - Not since then, I'm totally clear. Listen, Nishiyama, I've got a favor to ask. There's a guy, and he could be looking at murder one if he isn't careful... I want you to testify that you saw this man with a mafioso... ...on the day in question. And you say this guy didn't do it? No way. I'll do it. Thanks a lot. How's Jonouchi's inspection coming? Heard anything new? Nope. Everybody's stuck on this one. Nishiyama's a better man than you give him credit for being. Yeah, that may be so, but we've only got his word, and no other corroborating evidence. We're still back to square one. Excuse me! All detectives are requested to gather in the assembly hall. What happened? - Usami's been sighted back in town. - Yeah, but that isn't our case. Huh? - We're busy. - I see. Here go all of the precinct's resources - to finding Usami. The department's honor is at stake on taking him down. The Yasuhara investigation will be cut as a result. Investigation HQ has been dissembled. You can relax now. But the negatives are still out there somewhere. The cops aren't even looking for blackmail evidence anymore. They won't just happen on that film. Excuse me, may I have a glass of water? Hey, my sister Sumiko's wedding was the day before yesterday... Oh, really? I think that's the first time I've seen your smile. - Really? - It's the first time. Here's your glass of water. Shiraishi and Yasuhara... I can't forget, the looks on their faces... their helpless last expressions. I don't suppose that I ever will. You never lose that stuff, do you? Same goes for me, too. It's Abukawa... just act normally. Hi, I didn't expect to see you here. This is my superior, Mr. Abukawa. He's Mr. Teranishi. Kasaya's a brusque little thing, but we love her. I've got something that I want to talk to you about. Do you mind if I borrow her for a minute? We've got another hot lead on Usami. We'll have his hideout in no time. Then, we'll be able to get back to work again. - Really? - Yeah. - Did you understand? - Yes. What'd he say? He said that the Usami case is about to break. We'll be back on the Yasuhara case pretty soon. - Here's your order. - Thanks. If you excuse me... And here's yours. Here you go. I sneaked into Yasuhara's apartment. Those negatives are bugging me. Abukawa's still on the case... - Abukawa's not doing a thing. - That's not what you said at the restaurant. Everything's exactly as I told you. The police aren't doing anything on the Yasuhara case. And the negatives? Nowhere to be found. I think that I was seen leaving by one of the residents. - You were seen? - It's okay, they didn't see my face. That's not it. If this is reported, and Abukawa finds out... He'd know that only the killer would try to get in there... ...to look for the incriminating evidence. Then, he'd be back on the track like a bloodhound. I'll go check out Koshinjo again. Maybe there's something we've overlooked. I'll go with you. You stay here. I don't know what I'll find there. The place might be crawling with cops. If anything was reported, Abukawa will call me first. - If my portable doesn't ring, we're okay. - Then, it's okay if I go with you, right? Let's go together. It's not here. Check back there. - Put everything back exactly as it was. - Understood. Who's there? Police Detective, ma'am. It's an urgent matter, we didn't have time to ask permission. - Is that permitted? - It's not uncommon. It's quite possible that the suspect will show up here. But... but why would he come here? It's not uncommon. He's another investigator. And what are you doing here at this hour? Huh? Well, I was out drinking with friends. The trains stopped, so I came here to sleep. It's not uncommon. Yes, well not tonight. It may become dangerous. - I'll have to ask you to go home now. - I guess you're right. Aren't these the keys that the suspect...? They were recovered from Yasuhara's car. They were misplaced in the precinct... What are you doing?! - It's me, Abukawa. - Kasaya speaking. Somebody's broken into Yasuhara's. The criminal's come out of hiding. - But why? - Blackmail evidence. He still hasn't found it. Go to the Koshinjo detective agency. I'll be checking some things at his house. - Understood. - Don't knock yourself out. - Was it Abukawa? - That's right. The negatives, the proof... Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. I'm sorry I wasn't able to identify anyone leaving the premises. No need to apologize. All right, let's review the facts once more. Firstly, the suspect was looking for the blackmail evidence. And he still hasn't gotten his hands on it. I disagree. He got it, and has disposed of it already. If that's true, then why set the fire? - To dispose of the body? - Because he couldn't find the evidence. But wouldn't the evidence have vanished in the fire either way? Perhaps. But couldn't it just as well be hidden somewhere else? Somewhere we've failed to look yet? I don't think so. How about in Yasuhara's car? I already looked there. Really? Well, if you're so positive... So, it must have been somewhere in the detective agency. All right, we'll work out a second line of investigation tomorrow. Do you prefer pork cutlets or tempura? For dinner. I should head home and get started on the report. Is that so? Well, I'm going to grab a bite. You're not even going to check first? You're usually more thorough than that. All of this for a man? Nobody in the department knows about this yet. You bring Teranishi in, make him give himself up. That's about all that's left of you right now. Yes? Yes, understood. They've found Usami. He's hiding in a building in Otanimachi. You join the rest and go after him. This is your last job. Let's pay him back for the last time. Usami’s on the third floor. He appears to have taken a waiter from the restaurant as a hostage. That's right nearby. Usami's left the hideout. He's on the run... He might be coming our way. What does it mean when somebody dies? I remembered the father's response in that movie. "All of the things that the deceased had said and done become remembered." I'd like to ask somebody myself... What does it mean to kill someone? But who can I ask? THE END
