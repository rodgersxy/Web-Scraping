ME VERSUS YOU - THE MOVIE THE MYSTERY OF THE MAGICAL SCHOOL MANY YEARS AGO... Old wiseman, Order of Scientists, Order of Fairies, we're in danger, all of us! We, the chosen ones, as well as all of humanity. Since the dawn of time the world depends on the alliance between our Orders. But today that alliance has been broken. Silence! - Cherì, what are you saying? - A magic object was stolen. Who did it? A scientist... Your brother. We must hide! And safeguard the Alliance's objects. If the traitor gets hold of the other three objects... - He'd have all the power. - That would be the end of everything. From now on, everyone is banned from using magic powers. We must lie low, so we are not found. TODAY... The school opens its doors again. "After 40 years of neglect and months of work by me, not to brag..." Sure, good job, nice speech. By the way, have your friends arrived? Yes, I mean no. My friends have been very busy lately. - They didn't answer my email. - Will they come or not? Of course, it's almost... it's fairly likely, even if... If for some reason they don't come, I could stand in for them. Because when it comes to shows, I'm in the know. - I'm a well-rounded artist. - Very round, indeed. Watch... Pals? Is this a joke? I should fire you! Hi, Pongo. Surprise! Shout louder so I can hear you This school is a blast, woo-hoo! We study history And geography Shout louder so I can hear you This school is a blast, woo-hoo! If you want to travel Imagination is your airplane It may seem insane But you can touch the sky Even without a plane You can, it's true Together we are magic Separately we are not And this is what really matters Oh, how I love dancing for hours When we're side by side Nothing stops our stride And I want to be happy Even when things are a mess Like when it rains And the sun is out all the same Shout louder so I can hear you This school is a blast, woo-hoo! Say it with your feet Say it with your hands Shout louder so I can hear you This school is a blast, woo-hoo! Go further down To go further up It may seem insane But you can touch the sky Even without a plane You can, it's true Together we are magic Separately we are not And this is what really matters Oh, how I love Dancing for hours When we're side by side Nothing stops our stride And I want to be happy Even when things are a mess Like when it rains And the sun is out all the same Shout louder so I can hear you This school is a blast, woo-hoo!

One, two, three One, two three Oh, how I love Dancing for hours When we're side by side Nothing stops our stride And I want to be happy Even when things are a mess Like when it rains And the sun is out all the same Sofi, Lui! What are you doing? Didn't you hear the bell? Go to class, now! Move it, I said! It's time! Eins, zwei, march! This school is wild! According to a legend, this used to be fairy school. And according to truth? A heap of abandoned bricks that Pongo brought back to life. You did a great job. Since when are you an architect? Since I was contacted by a benefactor who paid for the reno. A benefactor contacted you? Yes, why not? Faster, faster, get inside. You're not an architect. - Don't tell anyone. - You're talented. Expertise is my middle name. - Ball? - I'll get it. Guess I'll fix that too. Did you not hear what I said? Go to class, now! Stupid idiots. We have to go now. Thanks guys, you made my day. We're always here for you. My friends. I said go to class! Didn't you hear the bell? It's time for school, move it! Sofi, you get prettier by the day. - And me? - You... You are... the same. Still handsome. Sir, the kids are all in class. Yes. We're glad you're safe here. Where do you think you're going? Us? We're leaving. Not before... Not before you meet the benefactor. - He's here? - Yes. And wants to meet you, come on. We're honored but... Useless blather from a useless girl. - Pals, you can't miss this. - Hush, Bongo. - My name is Pongo. - The benefactor hates waiting. Thanks, but we'd rather leave. Fine, we know you have a full schedule, I'll go see the benefactor on their behalf. - Is she always like that? - Always. - Move it, Tonto. - You get used to it. Bye, pals. What a pity, such a cool school run by a principal who's so... - So... - Mean. Weird. She's a real witch and we left Pongo alone with her. It's unlike us. Let's go get him. Pongo? Pongo? Don't forget we're in a school. He must be in here. Pongo, we're back! Didn't she tell me not to yell? Hello, Ms. Principal, have you seen our friend? Your friend? Is that what you call "friendship"? You left him on his own in a time of need. Some friends you are. Pongo! Did he faint? Is he dead? Not yet, he's asleep right now. - What have you done? - He drank the juice I gave him. Which happened to be poisoned. - Why? - Orders from the benefactor. Perfidia! Mister S! You are a monster! You're right about that! I asked for taller stilts! You're right, sir. But I underestima... overestima... under... I'm sorry! Am I the only one with a brain? - Do I have to do everything myself? - Is that your voice? The microphone! This is my real voice. - Is that your face? - Yes. Silence, this is my voice. This is my voice. This is my voice. This is my voice. Silence! Who's laughing now? Mister S. Guys, run! Don't mind him, he'll wake up and fall asleep again until he no longer wakes up... Ever again. Unless... - Unless? - The antidote. - Give it to us! - And what will you give me? I'll tell you what. The treasure! What treasure? The one this map will lead you to. It's hidden in this school. Many have gone looking for it but none came back alive. - Why would we succeed? - Because you're different. Because you have to save your friend. Give us the treasure and we'll give you the antidote. No treasure, no antidote. Goodbye, Bongo. Pongo, my name is Pongo. This is how much time is left. Once the time is out, the antidote will no longer work. You'd better hurry, or your friend will be asleep forever. - I can't believe it. - Me neither. How can Mister S go around with that hair and leotard? Knock it off, I was talking about Pongo. Right, we're in trouble. - What'll we do? - We'll find the treasure, we'll hand it to that monster and we'll save Pongo. We just have to follow the map, right? It's not that easy, there's nothing on it. We were just in the principal's office and now we're in the hall, the map shows a door here. But there isn't one. Impossible. If this was a fairy school maybe there's a secret passageway. An invisible door. And? I'll turn the invisible knob, open the invisible door, and go into the invisible passageway. Did you happen to forget the invisible key? You're right! Lui, do you honestly believe this legend about fairies? I'll believe anything that can help us save Pongo. Dear fairies, if you're there, give us a sign. How'd you do that? I don't know, I knocked and it appeared. Ladies first. What a gentleman, but after you. Right, after you. You, who? Fine, let's go in together. Yes. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Where are we? - It's the same school but different. We went through a magic portal. Legend, my foot! We're in the fairy school. Fairies are good, right? What's this? Some writings appeared on the map. "Anyone who comes to help, will be given help. Anyone who comes to take, will be taken." Taken? We're here to take away the treasure. What does this mean? If we touch the treasure, they'll get mad. Run! The portal is open! They've gone in. This is quite the discovery, Mister S. Discovery? You have no idea what is behind there. Why, what's behind there? Magic. Let's go. Sir, what's the point of following them? If they decide to give up, my gun will convince them to carry on. Sir? - And Pongo? - I'm right here. Pals, be careful! Run, run! We're safe. What happened with the lockers isn't normal. No. Get the book! The route is appearing. We have to cross the garden, go back inside through the back door, and go to the Flying Room. Okay, it seems easy enough. It's so amazing! I'm skeptical, this place is odd. - You're just a scaredy-cat. - I think it's a trap. Follow my lead, I'm not afraid of anything! I was imitating you. Scared of a sweet, graceful butterfly. Hallucinogenic! Hallucinogenic butterfly garden Sofi? Sofi? Where are you? Are you trying to play hide-and-seek? What is this? Kira? Ray? How odd! Put me down. - You can talk? - Obviously. Sofi? What happened? Get rid of that butterfly. Let me kiss you. My love, it's me. Mrs. Marisa? Is this a nightmare? It's a hallucination, a trick by the fairies. - You were right. - Yes. My intuition never fails. Let's go that way, quick. Coming. So this really is the school of... - Fairies? - Yes. Of course, indeed. Idiot, behind here is... Who's behind there? Who? Who do you think? Great craftsmen! It's a set, it's fake, it's... Magic. To thwart treasure hunters. - To fart? - To thwart! To crush, to kill. Fairies are capable of anything. Yes, yes. Start clearing the way, cretin! Sir, the role you're playing is brilliant, pretending to believe the fairies' wrath with whoever steals the treasure, so the cretin gets scared and obeys. Brilliant. But you don't really believe the legend, do you? Sir? Sir, where has that idiot gone? Hey! Anyone here? I don't like this place. She's not a legend. "Cherì, founder of the Order of Fairies." Have you ever seen her? In person, I mean. She's a powerful enemy. An enemy? A fairy? What weapon does she use? - Her heart. - Her heart? The heart could never hurt anyone. Is lunch ready? I'd like eggplant parmesan. No. Donuts with sugar. Why do I always have to push you? Stupid idiot. Coming, sir. Right away! Go. Fantastic. Insane, this room is upside-down! - You need to fly to study in here. - What do we need to do? We just have to go out that door. How'll we get up there? By flying. Since when can we fly? The book is lighting up again. Read it. I, Cherì, founder of the Order of Fairies and principal of this school, welcome you. If you're here, it's because you are magical and special. Chosen. This might scare you, maybe you don't feel worthy. But you are worthy. You will fly, cast spells, and much more as long as you believe in yourself with all your heart. Because that's where the greatest magic comes from. And you'll need magic for your mission to protect the Alliance and the objects entrusted to us. The four objects of the Alliance. Each grants a different power. Altogether, they grant an absolute power. That's why they were divided between the two Orders. Two for us, two for the scientists. And why is that so? So that the powers are balanced and the world is balanced. And now, it's time to practice flying. Good job! This is the first step to flying. Be careful. You'll fly soon. - Does it say how can we fly? - No. Help. How'll we do it? Time is ticking, we need that treasure. No treasure, no antidote. No antidote, no Pongo. Here's an idea. I'll climb on your shoulders to reach the door. New idea. I'll climb on your shoulders to reach the door! I'm taller, so I should climb on your shoulders. What? Sure, you climb up since you're not strong enough to hold me up. I can hold you up, I'm more athletic than you think. Can you reach it? Not quite, get on your tippy-toes. Ok, but I'm not athletic. Are you okay? I guess. We need a new plan. I have an idea. I'm afraid, what is it? - I'll fly with you. - On a broom? Are you Harry Potter? Like Cherì said, we're here because we're magical. - She wasn't talking to us. - Relax, it's not dangerous. Flying? The two of us on a broom? Without helmets? - No way. - Trust me. - The greatest power is in the heart. - And? And we'll fly together. You just have to believe. I believe that we'll get hurt. - Get on. - It goes the other way around. You're right. Hold on tight. Let's fly! It didn't work. Put it back, or the fairies will get mad. - We're stuck here. - Let me think. - What's going on? - The room's spinning. - The world's spinning. - How bizarre! Careful! Okay. It's another fairy trick. It's a magic room. Give me your hand. We can go out now. Let's go! They were here. Stupid idiot. I hate those two kids. I hate this heavy sack of potatoes. I hate this place and all this fairy nonsense. I just hope the treasure is worth the hassle. There is no greater treasure. - Will we be rich? - Better. We'll be powerful! Rich, powerful. It's all good. I appreciate and believe in them both. As opposed to fairies and magic. You should believe in them. I would if something incredible and illogical were to happen. Like if Pongo were to become Prince Charming. Are you talking about me? Will you be my princess? Are you talking about me? Will you be my princess? Are you sure you weren't talking about me? There's something strange in the air. - It wasn't me. - Something very volatile. Fine, it was me, it happens when I sleep. I'm sorry. I give up, I believe. To The Flying Room, let's go. How do I make him go back to how he was before? Sorry. Disgusting. Move it. Fine, I'm coming. There's a secret passage here. Where are we? Where we should be. Look! Another route has appeared. Spell Room. Poorly-aged snail slime. Disgusting. Orange-flavor lynx eye. And this? Dirty ingrown dragon nail. We're not ready to deal with these magic gizmos. Surprise doors, hallucinogenic butterflies, upside-down rooms. And now dirty ingrown dragon nails. It's too much, let's go back. And what about Pongo? What now? Don't move. No worries, I'm paralyzed. I know that bears don't see you if you don't move. Maybe it'll work with him. Retreat! We won't survive in this magic world. - What should we do? - Go back to normal life. Pongo will die! This way it's us who die! Yes, that's very likely. They haven't given up yet. How impressive! I'm about to give up. Miss? Can I have this dance? What? There's no music? No problem, leave it to me. I love and adore you Like a plate of beef stew I love and adore you Like a plate of beef stew Sleeping Ugly has finally finished his show. Where am I? And where are my friends? What's this noise? Millenary iron. I know what's in there. The iron knights. Lui and Sofi are in the Spell Room, let's go! - Perfidia? - Yes, sir. I'm coming! I don't even want to know what's in this Spell Room! Move it. Are you still here? Come on, move it. My head is spinning. Well, this is The Flying Room. - And now? - We need a miracle, or magic. I don't want to be skewered, do something! - What? I'm not a fairy. - You made the magic door appear. We're in the Spell Room, do something! What? There's a book, maybe it can be of some help. - How can I reach it? - I'll distract him. Run! Mr. Knight, why don't we talk it out like gentlemen? How do you pee with that outfit on? You're so touchy, I was just being curious. Sofi, all set? - I can do it. - You have to! No need to get so upset. Sofi, hurry! - I can do it. - Do it. Shrinking spell. "Miniscule as a flea, smaller than a tadpole, may you become teeny-tiny." It worked. What did you do to me? You're safe from the knight now. Thanks, but you turned me into a mosquito. Lui? Do something. What can I do? Mosquitoes are annoying, so annoy him! You're right. Attack! Yes, that's working! I'm almost inside, it's so hot in here. You did it! We did it. Sofi, do it again. I lost the page. - Give me a hand! - A hand. I've got it. "Help Lui against the secret force, give him a hand, of course!" What did you do? I asked the book for a hand, it gave you two big ones. Take this, wimps! - Sofi, do it again. - All right. Where was it? I lost it. How did it go? I lost it. Help me against the secret force, give me a hand, of course! What the... I think I messed up a few words. Find another spell. How can I with these big hands? Hey, heaps of rusty iron! Come take it out on me if you're so brave! - What's your plan? - Just watch. Snail slime. - We did it. - Yes. That must be the exit. I think so. The Spell Room. It looks like my kitchen when I tried to cook an egg and it exploded. They defeated the iron knights, they're talented. Talented? Yes, my friends have many talents. Hidden talents, visible talents, inherited talents, learned talents. - Cut it short! - They're amazing. And they'll ditch you. The more talented they are, the more selfish they are. - Not them. - They're no different than you and me. I don't find that funny at all. The only thing we all care about is ourselves. Our health, our wealth, our backyards, and what others think about us. - Did I forget something? - Yes. Power! Take it from me Malice can be good to a degree A lie is better than the truth, you see Those who take Are better than those who give And don't even care if you live No need to pour a glass for me I'm thirsty but for power, you see You ask what I'm thinking about Myself! Try doing the same no doubt We will never be like you, I say You'll never be like us, no way We will never be like you, I say You'll never be like us, no way No way No way Take it from me Call me Your Majesty Here sadness reigns Me Versus You are pains You have no escape You have no chance No need to pour a glass for me I'm thirsty but for power, you see You ask what I'm thinking about Myself! Try doing the same no doubt We will never be like you, I say You'll never be like us, no way We will never be like you, I say You'll never be like us, no way No way No way My friends aren't like that. They are. When they get their hands on the treasure they'll forget about you. Liar, they love me. They're fighting for me. Face it, we'd all choose power over a good friend. No, they are going to save me. Sucker. Sir, what's going on? Go back to sleep, heap of metal! This way, follow me. Sir? And Sleeping Ugly? Deal with him. Full speed ahead! I wonder why it's all dilapidated. It's like your closet after you've looked for a dress. Very funny. This must've been the school's most important room. Look! The genealogical tree of the two orders. Generations of fairies and scientists. How cool. There are so many of them! There are two empty frames on top, I wonder why. There's a fresco on that wall of the lady we saw in the book. Right, her name's Cherì, she's with her pupils. There are more frescoes here too. Let's go. Careful, everything is creaky. The old wiseman with the four magic objects: the gem, the hourglass, the coin, and the ring. - I wonder what powers they have. - Yeah. This fresco is different, it's grim and creepy. The disruption of balance. Who is this man crushing the others? I don't know, but he's holding the magic ring and it must not be a good thing since he's a bad guy. I don't like this situation, we're getting into trouble. Don't worry, they're just paintings. We're here to get the treasure, not to steal the magical objects. The book! "Our worst nightmare has come true. A scientist betrayed the Alliance and stole an object from us, fairies." We must hide! And safeguard the Alliance's objects. If the traitor gets hold of the other three objects... - He'd have all the power. - That would be the end of everything. From now on, everyone is banned from using magic powers. We must lie low, so we are not found. Cherì, I personally entrust you with the Gem of Everlasting Life. You must keep it safe. Guard it with your life. Anyone who comes to help, will be given help. Anyone who comes to take, will be taken. We're officially in trouble. Mister S brought us here to take one of the fairies' objects. We cannot do it, we'd betray the Alliance. What should we do? We have to save Pongo, that's for sure. - Time's running out. - Oh, no! We need a solution. We shouldn't have come here and upset the fairies. - Lui, help! - Sofi, no! Help me! Where are you? I'm so scared. I'm afraid of the roots, and I'm afraid of losing you! You, nasty weeds, where have you taken her? Oh, no! I didn't mean that, you're lovely weeds, put me down. Where are you taking me? Let me go, stupid roots. Sofi, are you here? Lui, here's the treasure. Sofi? You're a fairy. It's incredible, they just wanted to help us. - They? - The roots. You call this help? They snatched you and took you away, leaving me alone in the dark. You know I'm afraid of the dark. All that matters is you're safe and sound now. Luckily we found it. And how about, "I was afraid of losing you, too." If we take this, we'll betray the Alliance. That's true. But if we don't take it, Pongo will die. What an awful dilemma. And since I'm not as bad as you think, I'll help you. - I'll take it. - We won't allow you! How dare you disobey me! She opened secret doors and cast some spells, too. She turned me into a mosquito. It's true. You think you're clever? I wanted you here, I invited you to the school. I used you to find the treasure, I knew you could do it. Because only a fairy could reach this place. - How do you know? - I used to be a scientist. You belonged to the Order of Scientists? I was one of those useless individuals who wanted to team up. But now I'm Mister S, the one who wants to rule everything by himself. And the magic objects will grant me the power to do that! You won't touch the Alliance's objects. Too late, my dear. I started a long time ago. The magic ring, he has it. - You stole it from the fairies. - From your mom, to be exact. You'll pay for this! I'll hunt you down, even your descendants. Forever. That's why you're here. I knew you'd open every door of the magic world. You nasty thief, you stole the object from my mom. You hurt me! You fairies and scientists. But I will now take what is mine, the absolute power! And I'll annihilate you all! Telekinesis. And this is just the start. The ring allows you to do that. Indeed, now give me the gem as well! Don't do it! You asked for it. Perfidia! Yes! We can finally let him die. Sorry, Sofi, we have no other choice. Perfidia, the box! Let her go and give us the antidote. There is no antidote. Adorable suckers! You made a useless sacrifice. - Just like every friendly gesture. - Or alliance. Are you happy now? Not yet. Not entirely. I love when you unleash your malice on losers. Sofi, he's about to kill us, do something! Do it for us, for Pongo, for your mom. Believe in your heart, work your magic. You are a traitor! Where have they gone? They disappeared, who cares! - They took the gem. - But we're safe. More or less. They stole the second object. There are only two left and it's my fault. - Our fault. - No, it's my fault only! I didn't defend the fairies' object. We did it to save our friend. What if we made the wrong choice? It was the right choice. We didn't want to disrupt the already unbalanced balance. We considered taking it. But we would give it back, multiplying the Alliance's dividend to equal a new treasure. I'll shut up. - Between Pongo and the gem... - You did the right thing. You've understood the real treasure we are protecting. Friendship, which we call "Alliance." Pongo! Pals! Being a fairy is great. Make sure to hide your powers, or you'll endanger the chosen ones. I didn't mean to lead Mister S here. I know and you must make sure he doesn't touch the other objects. - He won't. - I know. Because you're not alone. Your union has deeper roots than you could ever imagine. Guys, I have bad news for you. I was promoted to principal, so I have to leave the band. Too bad. I love you, pals. Yay! We had an incredible adventure. And you know what? The real treasure is our friendship. Hold on, I forgot one last thing. I'll be right back. We feel like heroes some days Mighty and strong From the outside we are always But we keep it inside too long Nothing can overwhelm In the invisible realm With magic you can use To do anything you choose It's an adventure that will always remain What matters is who you are Not what you gain A sea of trouble we'll surf together It doesn't matter about the weather It'll always be us two I'd rather lose than lose you Even if I never win At times we feel free And invincible with glee When we lose a treasure We might also lose motivation Mister S is not in the right Even if he won this fight But it's sad and grim No one will celebrate with him It's an adventure that will always remain What matters is who you are Not what you gain A sea of trouble we'll surf together It doesn't matter about the weather It'll always be us two I'd rather lose than lose you Even if I never win The magic of memories I know it will never end Even if the world crumbles I know you'll hold it up And will be my backup It'll always be us two I'd rather lose than lose you Even if I never win Sir, I have good news. We've located the third magic object. It'll be ours soon! Sofi and Lui, this is just the beginning!
