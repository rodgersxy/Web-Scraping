Ramachari! He is a great detective! TIHAR JAIL IS FOR HARDENED CRIMINALS Brother! Harishchandra Prasad is going to be the next Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. The swearing-in ceremony is tomorrow. I lost everything because of... Harishchandra Prasad. I am rotting in jail because of him. I cannot wait... to kill him now. Kill him! You better kill him! Don't worry. I'll do anything to bring that look of joy back to your eyes. Send our men to Hyderabad. I must hear the news of his assassination tomorrow. Excuse me, sir! Good morning, sir. - Stay alert at CM's swearing-in ceremony. - Sir. You are not even allowed to blink your eyes. Sir! - What is the matter? - IG is calling you inside. What are you talking? If he calls, should I come? Never. You leave. - Wait. - Sir! I will come, ask him to receive me. Sir... The stairs are this way. I take the road less traveled. I chart my own course. Come here. Oh, God! Good morning, sir. -Block the roads that the CM will use -Sir! until the ceremony is finished. We do not have to block the roads. Our city is known as a traffic jam city. Do not look at me. Look that way. - Chinta, stop that. - Sorry, sir. Where is that dog? The Hutch dog or a fur dog? Not the dog with fur, but the crazy one. Who chose a crazy person like you for this department? It was you! "You're unproductive in the village, wandering like a loafer, failing the 10th grade, - good for nothing..." - Stop it! Do we need these details now? - Not really. - Go check if the dog squad has arrived. Go check! Hey Tata, get that dog. Arjun, step out by putting your right foot forward. Dear Arjun, step out by putting your right foot forward. - Is he a groom or what? - Sir! What's with the long face? It looks like you're from another planet! - Salute me! - I did salute you in the morning, sir! Not you! Him. Hey, I am your father-in-law. Why would I salute you? When did I marry your daughter? Not you! Him! Hey, when I am on duty, I do not care about relatives. - And when you are not on duty...? - Relatives do not care about you. Why are you acting up while saluting me with the same hands that washed my feet? Brother-in-law, let it be. Even Lord Vasudeva touched a donkey's feet. Do you mean our sir is a donkey? What do you know about donkeys? A donkey is a domestic animal. Shut up! Do not go into the details. They did not say anything. You are overdoing it. Salute me! Are you trying to swat flies or salute? Can't you salute properly? Do it the right way. Try again. This won't work anymore. Tell him to devote one hour daily to practice saluting. Then ask him to salute me. - Okay, sir. - Now ask him to do his duty. - You heard that, right? - Search. Okay, sir. Do it. Go on. Check my back pocket as well. Oh, God! - I didn't request a search on me. - Sir. Search the building! Call the dog. Arjun! Why is he barking? He is not barking. He is asking you to salute him. I will never salute a dog. Never! - He is your boss. - Nevertheless. He's struggling to focus, sir. Why not simply salute the dog and avoid any issues? Do it, sir. Please do it. You're making me salute you? I will deal with you later. Come on, search! - Long live! - CM Harishchandra Prasad. - Long live! - CM Harishchandra Prasad. - Long live! - CM Harishchandra Prasad. I, Yelamanchali Harischandra Prasad. I, Yelamanchali Harischandra Prasad. -I solemnly pledge, -I solemnly pledge... Damn it! Where is my cap? Oh! The cap is as faulty as the department. Shit! - Let's go. - Go. Stop! Stop it! Wait. What happened? Sir, I am the CM's escort, but the convoy is leaving without me. - Wait, I said, stop. Stop! - Stop! Andhra Pradesh has finally elected a qualified CM. Who will protect him if his security is so weak? I am observant, like Sherlock Holmes I am of the 007s cult I am a wise and intelligent man If criminals cross the line If mafia dons try too hard I am so sharp that I can fool anybody I get hyper when questioned Nobody can stop me I will come like a generous man I will do everything like a lion I will shake you rapidly I will crush you very easily I am observant, like Sherlock Holmes I am of the 007s cult I am a wise and intelligent man If criminals cross the line If mafia dons try too hard I am so sharp that I can fool anybody Chari... Ramachari 008! Even in the face of darkness Even in the midst of extreme adversity If troubles arise intermittently And if misfortunes occur inexplicably I will make all of it come to an end I will clean pollution! If swindlers try to deceive And evil forces conspire I will attack like a cyclone Beware of me I will come like a generous man I will do everything like a lion I will shake you rapidly I will crush you very easily Was that you? How many times do I have to repeat myself, idiot? - You were supposed to mix soda, right? - To mix it, I need to have it first. - The total is 15,000. - For alcohol, that is all? Not for the alcohol. It is the grocery bill of your beloved nephew. - So much? - Sunday or Monday, eat eggs every day! Where are the eggs I put in the fridge? Chickens lay eggs. When did you start laying eggs? - I will break your eggs! - And the yolk will leak! Where are the 25 eggs I stored for breakfast? Oh, my God! 25 eggs per day? It's not per day. It's per meal. Per meal? I must eat enough food to pass the physical test. Excessive eating leads to medical tests, not physical. No father keeps track of their child's food intake. I do! Anyway, are you eating to live or living to eat? Why trouble my baby over eggs? - He's not little. He's gigantic! - Dad! Enough, stop it now. Baby, have some milk. A jug might not suffice. Give him a pot full of it. Dad, please stop. Don't give me the evil eye! - Mom, it's time for juice now, anyways. - I didn't buy any oranges, Son. What?! That means no vitamin C today! - We got vitamin xxx instead. Want to have? - Stop that. You are to blame for my father's drinking today. I might be responsible for your dad's condition, but your bro-in-law is responsible for his habits. - My brother-in-law? - Yes, Chintakaya. He has no respect for his father-in-law, always asking him to salute him and insulting him. Don't get too worked up about it. He is already being tortured by... Ganguly! You are a thief. You stole my heart. Thief! I lost my phone. Thief! - I lost my watch. - I lost my chain! Stay away from the yellow house. He won't even set foot in there. Why? Why do you talk unnecessarily? - Bless us, Father-in-law. - Who the hell is your father-in-law? - Shut up and leave! - Dad? Okay. Even if the sun were to rise in the west, or if you held a gun to my head, or if one of us were to stab the other, - I would never set foot in this house. - Don't! Leave right now! - That's final? - Yes. Yes! Hey! Why did he get into this house? Come inside. - Sure? - I won't. Okay. You promised not to set foot in my house, yet here you are! I am not interested in coming here. A thief broke into your house. Yes, long ago, a thief broke in and stole my daughter. I am not referring to that one, but the cunning one inside now. - You get in and send him out. - Go in and look for yourself. - Get in boys! Search for him. - Okay, sir. Got you, thief. You are done! - I do not want it. - We are not offering it. - Sir! - Sir! - He is not there. - He is not there. - You're already back? - That's because he's already left. - Where did he go? - He tricked us, sir. Tricked us?! - Go get the van! Now! - Yes. Hey Arjun, stop! Why are you barking so much? He is telling you that nobody is hiding here. - Sounds like Ganguly? - It's not him, for sure! Hey, who placed your head here? Other parts of my body are on the ground floor. With whose permission did you enter this house? Do not scream. There are police outside. The police are present even inside this place, so you are under arrest! You are even worse! You ignore your buddy's arrival and talk about arresting him instead. What is this? Why are you pushing the car? - The driver is not there, sir! - Damn, even I do not know how to drive! He can drive. Hey, it is you? Ganguly! Arrest him! Not required. I am surrendering myself! Hey, move! Hey, I will break your bones if you step into this house again. You are looking at him but threatening me. How dare you threaten me? I will not spare you! Stop. I respect you for marrying my sister even though we couldn't offer a dowry. But because of that, if you dare insult my father in public... I will forget that you are my sister's husband. Leave! Excuse me, sir. What do you want? Get a kilo each of red gram, black gram, salt, papadum... Sir, this is not a grocery store. It's a shoe shop. - Is it? Then show me some shoes. - Here. To hell with this one! Show me the black ones. Oh, dear. - Be careful. - Yes, sir. Gosh, you are so nice! Is this a shoe store or an eunuch store? - I'll pay and leave. - I will come with you, my boy! - For what? - Company! Parking place. Oh, God! Stone on a ring is fortune, but in a sock, it's hell. - Who the hell hit me? Who? - I think it's Samarasimha Reddy. He might have come to kill us. It is not the time to open the umbrella. It is time to run! Hey, stop! My shoe! My shoe! - Poor fellow. - Shoe! Shoe! - Here, take this. - My shoe! - Attitude! - Hey! Hey, my shoe. - Sorry. - Hey, want to die? - I lost one shoe, and hence I'm hopping. - Shut up, you lame fellow! Get lost. You get lost. Shit! Sorry, boss! Your wife just eloped. I don't need you anymore. Oh, the wife is back. But the husband is gone! Hey, my wife. My wife! -Faster -Shoe! - Go fast. - Shoe! The CM will arrive at four in the evening for a routine check-up. - Sir. - Be careful Okay, sir. Hey, mister! Come back. Here is the VIP Block. This is CM's check-up room. This is the bomb placement area. CM will wait exactly for half an hour. - Bomb must be set properly. - Okay. Hey, the phone is ringing. Pick it up! This guy is sleeping like a log. The call must be from one of my customers. Hey, put this back. - Hello? - My name is Sattibabu. Is this the Police Station? He is not my customer. It must be his. Oh, God! Sir, call for you! Hello. - Nothing much. - Then hang up! Sir, listen... I am going out of town for a month. How does it matter whether you go for a month or six? Hang up now! The police requested that we inform them at the station if we go on a vacation. - Lady, what is with you? - Hey! Come again. Sorry, that was not for you. Write down the address, sir. You hold on, sir. Ask him for the address, and I will note it. Flat number 12C. - Flat number 12C. - 12C. Rainbow residency. - Rainbow residency. - Rainbow residency. - Jubilee Hills. - Jubilee Hills -Jubilee Hills -Hyderabad. I can rob peacefully. - Happy Journey and vacation. - Thank you, sir. Here it is. Damn, you wrote down the address? You are not supposed to remember stuff like this. Forget it all. Forget it. You know about me. I can only write, but I cannot read. Poor you. You have been dealt an unfair hand in this matter by God. You are so brainless. Hey, how are you out of the prison? You do not know the trick, right? Hold on. I will give you a demo. Take it out to get in or out of the gap, then put it back. - Do not ever do it again. - Okay. I am very sleepy now. Do not disturb me. You guys can also take a nap. We'll go to sleep. You guys also go to sleep. Bloody calls. - Hello? - There is a bomb in RMM Hospital. Come fast... What? A bomb?! Hello? Not sure if it's a real or a hoax call. I will inform the Control Room. Oh, no! It is a risk if it's a hoax. Let Chintakaya take the risk. Hubby, Sattibabu asked us to look after the house. Not just the house, I will look after his wife also. Mind your tongue! He just asked us to look after the house. As long as Chintakaya lives here, nobody dares to break in here. Here is my Obulapuram Mines. Taxi? Can you take us to RMM Hospital? - Hey lady, where is 12C? - Twelfth floor. Thank you. Who are you? I am 36, Chow How Shaolin, Manipur, owner of 12C. Oh, God! What a gift! Sorry, sir. Sorry. Sir? Mr. Chintamani? Man, looks like he's gone deaf. Mr. Chintakaya? Mr. Chintakaya! - What is it? - Come fast. They put a bomb. Bomb?! It might explode at any moment. Hey, there is a bomb in the building. - Stop your prayers. Let's get out. - Oh, my God! My house. - Sir, please help carry! - Come! - Not me, my grandfather! - Him? Leave him here. Save on nursing charges, and come with me. - Hey, what is happening? - Bom... - Ba...? - Bom... Okay, leave! - Hey, what happened? - There is a bomb in the apartment. Bomb?! Oh damn, he is coming this way. If he spots me, he'd blast me! Oh, God! Damn, if I jump from here, I will die. Oh, Lord, what have you done? I've got an idea! A mattress in the front, a mattress at the back. This is a brilliant idea. Say yes to sandwich massage! Ambulance? Look at his sincerity! He came on duty without changing into his uniform. Salute, sir! To hell with your salute! Get in the car. The bomb might blast at any moment. What? There is a bomb here too? What are you saying? You just announced the bomb here. - Bomb is in RMM Hospital. - RMM Hospital?! Hitting a cop on duty is a punishable offense. - Dear, listen to me... - Let's go! Hey, you leave! - Thanks. - Not that way, - this way! - Oh, shit! - Take the dog squad and go. - And you? - You go first. - Scared of the bomb! Oh, God! What is causing Kota to delay in getting the dog? Why are you late, Kotachari? It is not Kotachari, it's Mr. Tatachari! - Is that you? - Yes, Betachari! Your father was supposed to come as a bomb squad. Why did you come instead? - Where is your father? - He's out cold. Booze made him sleep. If we wait, many people might be dead. So, I decided to come instead. Okay, let's go. Anyway, who must have planted the bomb? You fool! You... - Damn, it went off. - What, the bomb? - No, my head! - I will see you later. Goodbye! What goodbye? Why did you hit me? - Why does one eat food? - Because they are hungry. - Why does one hit? - Because they feel like it. - Why ask when you already know? - He hit me again! Serves you right! That is why cops must have a helmet. - Put it on. - Then give it to me. - Not mine, yours. - Oh, mine is with me. - We reached hell already? - Hey, we reached the hospital. Not much difference! Who is the doctor? - Mohan Babu! - Murali Mohan would have been better? - Uncle? - Tell me, Rama! - I have a small doubt. - Tell me. How will we know where is the bomb? We will know from the sound of the bomb Wow! Well said. Once the bomb explodes, what on earth can we do then? We will get to know by the ticking sound of the bomb. Do not remove the thermometer till I ask you to. Okay, nurse. Your attention, please. This man is backing up. Hi! Hello. Not you. The girl. It is me! Did you not recognize me? - Hey, take that helmet off! - Sorry! Why are you looking at me like that? The car is below the shoe, you are inside the car, and I am following the car. It was me who got stuck with the lorry. In this hospital, there is a huge bom... - Do not leak the information. - Why? This is a hospital. There might be many heart patients here. Sorry! Something bad is going to happen here. Get out here! Run for your life! Bye. - Uncle... - What? The bomb is in that room? - Did you see it? - Nope, I heard! Oh, that hurts! Let's go. Not that way, this way! That is the sound of the wall clock! The terrorists have planted a bomb inside your T-shirt. Hold on, I'll defuse it. Idiot! - That was dreadful, almighty! - Not almighty, it is Rama! - Hey, Chari is that you? - Yes, dude. - What are you doing here? - There is a bomb in the hospital. - That's why. - Bomb?! Oh, no. Oh, God! Help me! You have given birth to a baby boy. Have a look, ma'am! What? Did I give birth to this fellow? Mummy! Arjun, what is the matter? Who the hell are you? Take the bag and run, Arjun! Run for your life. There is a bomb in the hospital. Oh, my God! Guess there are gold biscuits in it. Thank you, Lord! Damn, why is he coming this way? Is he going to bite my leg? Oh, no. The bomb is in that bag. Run for your life! Damn, I thought it was God's gift. But It was a gift that sends you to God! Never mind! Arjun! Come on, fast! Everybody, run out of the building! I am having a bad day! I must go to Nityanadha Swami and check my fortune. Stop. Where is this bus off to? Is this a bus? I hope you do not want to board it! - I want to go downstairs. Can you help? - Sit here. I will take you to the top. If we go up, we will die! There is a bomb in this hospital. - Bomb?! - Yes. I've never witnessed a bomb blast up close. - Come, let us go! - Oh, no! It's not a sight akin to watching a Diwali cracker. It is a time bomb. We will die if it blasts. That is exactly why I am asking you to come. - Hello, doctor! - Hello, doctor! - You! - He kicked me! You're whiter than a foreign chicken. What's your diet like? I'm a princess! With a beautiful appearance! You douche! Give me my clothes back! Come out and take it yourself. Oh, no! I will not. Nobody must come here. Arjun, take the bomb far away. Go! Fast! Move. Arjun! Run fast. Drop the bomb! Drop it! Drop it now. Fast! Come! Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! I want information on the CM's assassination. This time for sure, sir! All we need is a cop to help us carry out this operation. - Mukesh Bhai? - Yes, Chadda. - Reason for calling? - I want you to kill a man. Consider it done. He's not a common man who can be killed easily. He's the CM. Whether it's the CM or anyone else, a bullet will draw blood. The city is on high alert. It's not safe for you to stay in a lodge. Shift to another place. I know how to divert this case. Nice to see you, Mr. Dramachari. Not Dramachari, it's D. Ramachari. Dokka Ramachari! Sorry. I am from the north. I am weak in South Indian languages. - It's okay, sir. - So, you want to be a cop? Yes, sir. It is my ambition. - Is it? - Yes, sir. If you can't handle a single blow, how will you manage the physical demands of police work? Why will anybody hit me, sir? Won't they hit you if you plant a bomb in a hospital? I did not plant the bomb, sir. I disposed of it! Are you a police officer to dispose of it? My father wasn't available, so I went on his behalf. Are you a youth leader to complete the unfinished business of your father? On one hand, I'm being applauded by the press and public for saving many lives. And on the other hand, you are interrogating me here? How dare you talk back to me?! - Stop it. Mr. Commissioner, what is this? - Sir! I'll explain, sir. There's a link between him and the bomb... - No, he is innocent! - But... Yes, sir. I have no clue. - I swear on my mother. - He is lying! - He's bluffing, sir. Believe me... - Wait. I know him very well. Who do you think you are? A hero? Show your heroism after becoming SI. Repeat it, and you'll face consequences. - Sorry, sir. - Get lost! Sir, do not let him... - See you. - Okay. - Stop, we are also coming. - Did they put you on duty at home? - No, they suspended us. - Why? You still have a hangover! Your father was removed for being drunk, and I for bringing you with me. - They fired us both. - Congrats, Dad! - You sit behind me and you in front. - And you ride it! We're not renting out this flat for money, but because my brother lives abroad. But we only want families to live here. - Grandpa. - They are really good boys, ma'am. They are working in the software industry. Only families live here. We are taking a huge risk by giving it to bachelors. Pay rent by the first of each month! Definitely, sir. Sir, this is three-month rent in advance. This is called an eye for an eye. Should I offer you a salute? A single mercy killing injection, and you'll be in heaven. - No, just get rid of it. - Stop it. Stop? Isn't this line typically heard at the end of a wedding? - Doc, you are not supposed to kill Arjun. - Why? You will kill him instead? Anyway, who the hell are you to interfere in my department's work? I'll not only interfere. One day, I'll own it as well. Read this. You said you'd own it. What is this paper for? It is an order passed by Amala Akkineni from Blue Cross to hand over the dog to me! - Oh, it is in English. You read it. - Never mind. The doc will read it. - Why? You cannot read either? - Shut up! - Doc, can I have a moment? - Okay. - I will also come. - You stay back. It's in English. Okay. Doc, this is not a real letter from Blue Cross. It is fake. That faithful animal saved the lives of hundreds of people and injured himself. Please be kind enough to save his life and hand him over to me, sir. I will look after him. No! I will not approve. If you do not agree, you will rot in your own jail. Blue Cross is a powerful organization. - What about mercy killing? - Kill him instead. We'd get rid of some pain. Hey, I am listening to all this nonsense because of you. - I will take my revenge. - Hey, leave! - Are you leaving or not? - Leaving! Wow! Suspended police officers are gambling first thing in the morning? - Aren't you ashamed? - Shameless! But we have our drinks! Where are you going so early, Son? - Going to give a test, Dad. - Urine test or blood test? Stool test! - Hey? - You must pour water in that. It is his physical test today, dear. Why don't you touch our feet and receive blessings? No, I do not want blessings from insincere people. The blessings of my mother are enough. - All the best, my son! - Thank you, Mom. Chari, your police uniform is ready. Do you want to try it? Oh! My sweetheart! My bag! Mr. Thief, you made a way for me to talk to her! That is true friendship, Ganguly! Chari, carry on! Excuse me. Hey! Hey lady, do not fear. Ramachari is here! Catch him. One minute, please. - Give me a coconut. - To drink or to go? To hit! Ganguly, Bengal Tiger! You can't even hit me with a coconut. That's a cop's shot! One minute, please. Oh, God! Are you a real cop or a fake one? Oh, God! - How do I look to you? - Like an SI. Let's stick to that. - Return the bag. - Why? Do you want to keep it? - Hey! - Oh, God! With trust in cops like me, the girls walk playfully with their purses in tow. If they carry it playfully, we will rob it peacefully. - You! - Oh, my God! - Shut up! - God! Anyway, you must also be careful. I know you have faith in me. Okay! But I am not omnipresent. You stole her purse in public because there was no one to stand up for her? From now on, I am there for her. - And I am there for you both. - Who is that?! - Hey! - From where did he come? - Brother-in-law? - Who is your brother-in-law? - Sorry, Mr. SI. When did you come? - I came long ago. I have been seeing your drama, you fake police. Right. He is the thief, and I am the cop! Police? At which station? Not one in particular. I work for all. I am a freelancing SI. Okay! Where did you steal this dress from? - I did not steal this, Brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law? Not again! Sorry, Mr. SI. I got it stitched! Got it stitched? Stop! Where are you going... like a cat! - I will kill you. - Sir. - I had already warned him, sir. - About what? I said, "If your bro-in-law finds out, both of us would be screwed." - You said that? - I did. Do you know what he said? "My brother-in-law is short with a huge tummy. How'd he screw us?" - Did he say that? - Yes, sir. When did I say all that? He is bluffing, lady! - Idiot! - Lady! - Hey, handcuff both of them. - Okay, sir. Not me, these two, you idiot! - You asked me to, sir! - Not me, them. Brother-in-law, I request you. I am getting late for selections. - Please let me go. - If I let you go, forget becoming a cop, you will become my boss. It is like two birds with one stone. Both of them are together. Sir! The thief left his hand and ran away. Trickery is his inherent nature. He might have gone, but I will not let the other one go! Oh, my! One leaves his hand, and the other leaves his shirt! Good morning, sir. - What? - Reporting, sir. What is the time? Nine sixty-five, sir. I mean, ten oh five, sir. What was the reporting time? - Ten o'clock, sir. - Out. - Please, sir. This is my ambition, sir! - Get lost! Rascal! Sorry, sir. He's telling me to leave just because I'm five minutes late. - Kindly consider me, sir! - Sir. Sir, he is late for the selections. How will he come on time for the job? Anyway, who is coming on time? Chari, you go ahead. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Next. Take my measurements quickly, sir. My muscles might shrink. - Write 90-95 cm. - I am supposed to say that. I am supposed to measure him. - Sir. - I will. I will measure him. You go first! Write down 200-225 cm. You come next. Come! Brother-in-law? My dear brother-in-law. No revenge, please. - Am I so cute? - Yes, Brother-in-law. Lift your hands! Write down 90-95! - Write 60-65! - No, 90-95! - Write 60-65! - No, 90-95, Brother-in-law. - Remove your hand. - Please, do not mess with my life. I beg you. I will touch your feet. Leave my legs. You will not get the job if you touch my feet. Look at the pole over there. If you can climb up and come back down this pole, the job is yours. - That is it? - Yes. - Sure? - Go! Is he already gone? Looks like Mr. Chari is trying hard to get this job. - So, will he crack it? - Highly unlikely! We have greased the pole with oil. Climbing up one step will set him back four steps. It is a job, not a joke! If you can't climb a pole, how can you be a police officer? Cops are supposed to be fit like them. One must have the strength to beat up men like these. All these guys are down. Am I fit now? Do you think hitting cops will get you selected? May they break their limbs! How could they hit my son like that? The police won't stay silent if someone hits them. Did they turn the police selection into a boxing match? Have some juice, Son. Have it, Son. No, Mom. This will not make me fit. I have spent a lot of money to become an SI. I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. Hey, Son. Fathers don't measure their children's meals. He wishes his son would eat well. Ignore the drunkard! Have some juice! Dad, I have dreamed of becoming a cop and fighting crimes since childhood. But I am now fighting to become a police officer. Son! Gold shines brighter when polished. You are like gold. You will surely reach your goal. One fine day, the whole department will salute you. Hello. Mike testing! - Was that necessary? - Was that necessary? - Do your work. - Stop! What's the progress of the case? It is getting dolled up at the guest house. I will fire you! I meant the investigations of the hospital bomb blast case. - How would I know that? He'd know. - Useless fellow! Sir, the investigation has been intensified. But... Sir, speak Telugu. Even the IG will comprehend. Do not look this way. - Look the other way. - Enough. Sir, this was planned by some terrorists. As they failed, they must have left the country. Are you not ashamed to say that? Round up all the criminals in the city and have Arjun identify them. Which Arjun, sir? Telugu Arjun or the Tamil one? My foot! The department dog. He has seen the criminals. Only he can identify them. But that dog is no more, sir. Unfortunately! - He died in the bomb blast. - Is it? - But Arjun... - Yes, that's what I am saying. He's dead. Arjun has recovered and is fully active now. That is it. Mr. Chinta, go and get the dog now. Sir, why am I always the one sent to get the dog? - Do I look like a dog catcher? - Then? - That dog is not in great shape, sir. - Why? After the blast, he has been roaming like a mad dog! - On top of that, his master is a madman. - That madman is his brother-in-law, sir. And there is a conflict between them. Yes, please take my seat and give him the details. You tell me. Sir, there should be no family or play during work. I will take the life of anyone for this job. - But you will not sacrifice? - What's the point of sacrificing my life? If anyone gives their life, we get good publicity. - Do not take my life. Go get the dog! - Well... I will cut your tail if you disobey. Nephew, Chintakaya is here! A brother-in-law kills his sister's husband. Do not read fake news. Where is Arjun? - Ask Krishna! - Let us go, sir. We must ask Lord Krishna. You will not reach Krishna if you go in a car... but when you come under one. Brother-on-law, tell me where the dog is. - He is talking to me right now. - What? He is talking to you? Does that mean you are calling me a dog? Every time they mention a dog, why do you react, sir? Connected through race! What is this? What is this get up? What is that counter for? What counter? I have taken a vow of silence. Vow of silence? But you are talking to me now. How would you know about my vow of silence if I don't speak up? How will I know that he took a vow of silence? Useless fellow! Brother-in-law, hand over the dog to me. Do not you dare call him a dog! You should call a dog a dog, not Mumaith Khan! Anyway, who needs your permission? I will drag the dog and take it away. Stop! Don't you dare take my dog without my permission! My department dares, even if I don't. - Hey, show him the department's directive. - Okay, sir. Well, that is north, and that is south. - Show east and west too! - Okay, sir. That is east... Oh, no! I dint ask you to show him north or south. The letter of directives from the government. - Sorry, sir. - Go! Arjun! He has bloated like a buffalo! What are you feeding him? No need for any treatment. Finish him off! - Why is he barking at me? - Barking dogs seldom bite. We will wait here, sir. You go and get the dog. You! Come here. I must give orders, not take them. Bro-in-law, I fold my hands with respect. - This dog... - Did you call him a dog again? I mean, Mr. Arjun. Please hand him over to me. Otherwise, my life will become that of a dog in the department. Now you are talking! This is not for you but out of respect for the department. - Thank you, Brother-in-law! - Hands off me! But I have some demands. - What kind of demands? - They say, every dog has a day. Today is the day of my dog. Our first demand is, an apartment for Arjun to stay. - An apartment?! - Yeah! - He needs a kennel. - Mani! Let him talk. - Number two... - You want to use the washroom? I mean our second demand is, Arjun needs a car with AC. Why settle for just an AC car when it's free? We will ask the CM for a helicopter. - Mr. Chinta. - This is too much, sir. IG is stuck with a non-AC car, and it's driving him crazy. - Will you stop it? - I will stop. Ask him to stop. Demand number three... Every day, he needs chicken eggs and legs, chili chicken, butter chicken, ginger chicken, pepper chicken, KFC chicken buckets, mutton noodle buckets, grilled chicken... Is it for you or the dog? That is about loading. What about unloading? - You can take him for a walk when needed. - Correct, sir. Me?! I'm not familiar with my children, let alone a dog's bathroom habits. Can I tell when it needs to urinate or defecate? Dogs don't whistle like pressure cookers. Sir, your SI is insulting my dog. I cannot take it anymore! Please wait, Chari! - Why are you forcing him, sir? - Will you stop it? Chari, hold on. - Listen, Chari. - Sir! I have the need, you have an opportunity. - I accept all your demands. - Thank you, sir. So, will you show me the apartment? This is the apartment for your dogs. Why are you looking this way? Look over there! You swore not to enter my home, yet you're here again, shameless! This is not that house. It might be another house, but the people living here are the same. Just because people are the same, you came wagging your tail behind like a dog! You are lucky! I will get it. Hey, Julie! - That is my dream girl. - Is that your dream girl? - Let me look at my dream girl. - Since when did you stoop so low? She looks like a princess. Don't push me. You look at your puppy, I will look at my girl. A girl! Sorry, Chari. Nevertheless, my bitch is better than your girl! Your son's all grown up. Find a good dog and get him married. After marrying my daughter off to a dog, why bother doing the same with my son? - Arjun, wait right here. - Okay, Chari. All the best! Hi, you stay in this apartment? Listen, lady... I was demonstrating how thieves steal ladies' purses. I am really a cop. You don't believe me? Hold on, I'll prove it. The one who called me fake was my junior officer. Hey, Chintamani! Get lost! Look, he is saluting with so much respect. - How can you go while I am still talking? - Move away. We will get the luggage by evening. Move away! Why are you talking in Hindi? - Don't you know Telugu? - What Telugu? - The ABCs of Telugu? - I do not know Telugu! I do not know Hindi. You do not know Telugu. - What is your name? - Douche! What a lovely name. Douche! Crazy! Not crazy. It is Chari from Chagallu. I'll kill you. Yes. I am here to pay the electricity bill. - Grandpa is inside. Come on in! - Thank you. What is it? Where are you taking me? Sir, I will fix it! - Hey, Douche! - What do you want? Cabbage! We have made eggplants in the morning! What the hell do you want? Did you make me a pimp for your love? Listen to me, Douche, your bitch and my dog are in love. Like Abhishek and Aishwarya. We must get the dogs married. - You want my dog to get married? - Exactly! Marriage of the dogs! Hey, Arjun. Your love is a success! Congrats! Do you not feel any shame for talking like that? Lady, I am not ashamed. I am Chari from Chagallu. You know English? No English, only Hindi. - That is hard. Look, Douche... - You! I am a boy, and you are a girl. We'd make an excellent pair. Leave! Now I know what your issue is. Leave right away! Oh, God! Douche, I love you... What are you doing to me? What is it, Arjun? - Dad. Get up and look! - What is it? Look over there. Do not scream. What is it, Brother-in-law? A thief broke in. A thief broke in? Was he hurt? Not that break. He is in the house to rob! Follow me. Man, that hurts! It is okay. You are a bachelor, right? Oh, God! Why are you following me like a train? Go in different directions and look for the thief. Hey. Hands up! Hands up! - Dad, it is me. - Sorry. - Hands up! - Tata, it's me. Quickly turn on the lights, can't distinguish who's who! Hey, turn around. Is that you? Yes, it is me. - What are you doing here? - But what are you guys doing here? We got this flat for rent. - What about Sattibabu? - Sattibabu is gone. We are here. Oh, shit! Where is my cash and gold? Oh, my God! Why are you crying like a doorbell? Oh, my God! Why are you here at this hour? We have to catch a thief. Call the dog. Come here. Stupid. What's the matter? Ganguly stole both the police report and the cell bars. - We have to catch him. - Must we all come along? No, one dog is enough! The rest of the dogs can stay home and eat chicken. I know where that thief is right now. Please tell me where he is. I will get promoted if I find him. In that case, I will never tell you! Fine, I will search for him myself. - Let's go. This idiot fell asleep. - Get out and catch him. Get up, man. Why are you still here? Get out. If I go out, that mad dog will bite me. I will stay here and live like a pet dog instead. What nonsense? But Chintakaya will identify him if he stays here. - Let's do one thing. - What is that? - You stand still. - Will you take a photo? No, I will change your look! Coffee. - Thief. - Not a thief, man. You changed my face, and you are unable to recognize me? Right. Thanks, Ganguly. - Why are you moaning like a dog? - That is not me. It is your dog, Arjun. Why is he moaning? Maybe he's sick. Before she gets to know... I better take her to the doctor and get her tested. Actually, he is my servant! - Servant? - Yes, servant! - Hey, admit it! - I will admit. - He is the servant of my dog. - Correct. - I am the owner of this house. - Yeah. I am a nice guy. Enough, bro. You're going overboard with the compliments in Hindi. Get your brandy in the evening, and I'll throw in some free snacks. Actually... Hey, leave. The water is getting cold. Go give a bath to Arjun. I bathed him yesterday. Regular bath sheds off his... - What? - His hair! You better leave, or I will pull your hair out. Hey, mister. Yes... If you bring Julie here again, I'll report you to the police. Exactly, I am a cop. Hey, Chari. You are a cop in which district? Bloody... Learning the official language today is a must, no matter what. Kuch Kuch... Hota Hai. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai? Oh, God! WHY FEAR WHEN IN LOVE? Pyaar Kiya To... Dar... Darna Kya. So, where is my honey bun? Baby! -I am in love -What? Why fear when in love? My heart wants love Heart is insane You might or might not know I am crazy about you I want to say something Something is happening I want to say something Something is happening I am in love Why fear when in love? I am in love Why fear when in love? Secretly and silently You made me nuts While walking, just like that I became yours My heart is yours. I am yours You made me a lover Tell Radha, from the heart One and a half letters of love Aishwarya-Abhishek Bachchan Amitabh-Jaya Bhaduri Ramachari-Geetachari, pair number one I want to say something Something is happening I want to say something Something is happening Shut up. What do you think of yourself? - This movie's name was not on my list. - Why are you troubling me? There should not be dialogue in a song. From doom to doom we journey Travelers on the path of love This is a story of love Lord made our pair You are alone, I am alone Made for each other When we met, there might not be tomorrow Never say goodbye, beloved I will be there, darling Will you marry me? The brave-hearted Will take away the bride I want to say something Something is happening I want to say something Something is happening I am in love Why fear when in love I am in love Why fear when in love Stop it! Are you crazy? You thought I'd fall in love with you if you sang some Hindi movie songs? You idiot. I am talking to you! - You are talking in Telugu? - My mother tongue is Telugu! I knew you'd trouble me more if you knew I'm Telugu. You fooled me? I will not spare you! I'll make you fall in love, marry you, have ten kids, make you a grandma even when your teeth are rid. I won't let you go, or I'll change my name instead! - Hey! - Arjun might leave Julie... But I will not leave you. I planned to impress you in Hindi, but you ended up troubling me! Hi, Douche! WELCOME HEARTY WELCOME TO OUR BELOVED CHIEF MINISTER, MR. Y. HARISCHANDRA PRASAD Move. What is the obsession with that dress? - It is my life's ambition. - Never mind... - This is your first alternation. - Operation! What's causing all the irritation? If you catch a bomb or a terrorist, - the entire state is going to be on fire. - Because of the bomb? Your name will be in small letters. My name will be in huge letters. Will you shut up? Hands up. That's enough. Don't even think about messing with me! - Hey, son. Look. - I am looking. - Not here, over there. - What is there? - There's nothing! - Where did he go? Excuse me. Hospital... Go and get the skateboard. Come, Arjun. Good boy! Let's go. Police must know what we are. Come on, Arjun. Very good. Yes, Arjun. Very good. Come on. Come on, Arjun. We must get him. Let's go. Come on, Arjun. Hey, stop! Stop. - Hello? - Ramachari. Dokka Ramachari! - What do you want? - Not me, but you. I caught the one who planted the bomb at RMM Hospital. Sir! Look! Our Commissioner is here! - Where is he? - At the top, sir. Sir, don't worry. There are thousands of people, and the media is on the way. - Sir! - You stay here. Sir, please save me! Sir, what are you doing? You must die. Or else, we will be caught. It looks like the killer has attacked the Commissioner. I will save him! - You? - Yes. What the hell? Got the point? - What are you doing here? - Sorry, sir. I am here to help you. I don't need you. Mind your own business. - I should not get involved? - Get lost. Okay. Come on, Arjun. Let's watch the show. Hey, pass me the gun. - Give me the gun, damn it! - You asked us not to get involved, sir. Hey! Behold the slayer of the killer. The generous. The brave. The mighty warrior. Ramachari! - Long live! - Ramachari! - Long live! - Ramachari! - Long live! - Ramachari! - Thank you. - Long live! Ramachari! - Long live! - Ramachari! Quite! - Rama? - Uncle. He is still alive. Hey! Sir, what are you doing? He is the sole evidence in this case. Leave me, or I will shoot you. No sir, please. No. - How dare you? - Commissioner! Sir... he held my collar. - No, sir. - I told him to... - He was going to shoot the killer. - Shut up, rascal. How dare you hold the Commissioner's collar in public? Listen to me, sir. He poses a threat to the CM. Hey! What threat are you talking about? It is not just the CM. Every politician has a threat. And it is our duty to keep them safe. Do you consider yourself more responsible than a collective of 75,000 police, more than 4,000 gunmen, 300 CM personal force, and Z-category security? Do you think you are a hero and more capable than all of them? I am not asking you to save him. But do not kill this guy. - Sir, if we interrogate him... - We know our duties. - We do not need your assistance anymore. - Sir... Your services are no longer required. Get lost. You added me in the department along with Arjun... so that I can help identify the terrorists, right? Now that you found him, you are asking me to leave? Got it, sir. Got it! - Constables, get the dog. - Yes, sir. I have dreamed of becoming a cop and fighting crimes since childhood. But I am now fighting to become a police officer. Keep moving. Faster. Hey, take that bag away. - What are you doing there? - The time has come to sharpen my blade. Are you upset because the government has taken away the dog? No need to worry. Numerous opportunities await. But they must have vacancies, right? Everything already has restrictions, and he is also restricted by age. Hey, stop brooding! I am not depressed about anything. I am contemplating. - About what? How to feel bad? - No. The Commissioner wanted to kill that killer... - For what reason? - To get rid of him. Stop it. Who is conspiring to kill the CM? Who is involved in all this? I ought to find out. Are you CID or James Bond to find that out? - Pardon? - Are you CID or James Bond? CID. James Bond. - Yahoo! - Oh, God! - Why did you scream? - Ants in his pants, perhaps. - Hey, that is a superb idea, bro. - Thanks. One who catches criminals is CID. I will open a CID office. I will help the department without joining officially. Yes! C.I.D. CHANTTABBAYI Oh, my! Looks like Arundhati's residence. Hey! There's no mouth or nose on him! You are now looking at my rear side. Bond. James Bond, junior! - Oh! That means you hid your face. - Yes. Detectives are always like that. They do not reveal anything to the public. No... don't touch! Don't touch anything. At any moment, anything can explode. This office is actually designed by my mentor. - But he is now into social service... - Once again! Therefore, he appointed me as a substitute in charge of this office. Okay. I will order tea for all of you. Oh, wow! - Please have it. - Take this. Here, take this. - How is the tea? - It is very cold. - Like a cool drink. - Like a cool drink. Do you want straw too? No, thank you. We are done. Will the hand come again to take our cups? No, a robot shall arrive. Damn! Who is he? It is similar to the Rajni movie robot. This one has more special effects than that. Mr. Pasupuleti! Why aren't you here after being called? Hey, this idol looks exactly like a man. - No! This man looks exactly like an idol. - Hey! He is a real man. - Really? - Yes. - His name is Pasupuleti. - Okay. Reporter in a prominent newspaper. You get him free with this office. You must keep him. - Thanks. - Come on, follow me. - Okay. - Oh, my. Not this way, over there. - This is a special car. - What is it? Selling this car won't fetch us peanuts. - What is so special about this? - Hello! Do not underestimate this one, man. This one has a lot of visual effects. - My PP will demonstrate all that later. - PP? - Yes, Pasupuleti Paparao. - Hey, this one has a hole. Hole? Where? - That is not a hole, man. - Then? It is an emergency starter. I will give you a demo. Look closely. I have designed it uniquely. So that one does not have to depend on anything or anybody. Like a bachelor marrying a pregnant wife, I got a ready-made office. So, now my advance? You took away everything I had. I am now broke. Here is your advance, sir. - CID Kota. - CID Ganguly. - CID Tata. - Move. Stop. Who is the boss? Come back! Let's go. - Basha! - Basha! - Oh, God! - Oh, no! Why are the dogs chasing us? I could've died. You never heeded my request to keep this douchebag out of the gang. The dogs ran behind us due to him. They did not follow us because of me but because of our costumes. From where did you get these costumes? It is itching. If you undress, I'll thrash you to a pulp. If we dress up, people will take notice of us. Your look will not get you noticed. To attract attention, your office should have a captivating name. - Then, it is CID Tata. - I will hit you with my Bata. Tata? People will come with cell phones and SIM cards, not cases. It must be stylish! I want style! Hey! You want style? Then name it, CID Donga Ganguly Singh Kadre! I will give you one blow, and you will cross the boundary. Can you guys keep quiet for a while? What is our second name? - Chari! - Chari! - What are you doing for Chari? - Corporation. When "co" is added to Chari? - Charico? - Not Charico. Chari & Co. Is Chari & Co similar to Venkatrama & Co? We have three Chari's in the group, right? We have "and" in the group, right? So, we are Crime Investigation Detectives. - Chari! - And... - Co! - CID Chari & Co! - The name is superb. - Thanks. That's fine, but now we must make it popular. Let's broadcast a live program on TV9. Hey, Chintakaya is praying to catch me. Chari & Co will become extremely popular if you catch hold of a criminal like me. Have I asked for trouble? You have given a wonderful idea, bro. Pasupu, you write an article. The criminal on the run from police, is caught by CID Chari & Co. Criminal Ganguly dodges the chasers and slips out. Where did he go? What is this? Like how a snake sheds skin, he left his uniform. Catch him. Sir, why do you carry Ganguly's photo in your heart? What to do? He is ruling my heart. Stop... Have you seen this guy before? What is this octopus Chintakaya doing here? I'll get caught! What do I do? I will go back. Police are present both behind and ahead. Stop... Who on earth are you? Sporting a bikini in broad daylight. What is this language, you fool? Anyway, have you seen this guy? That is me! - Where did he disappear? - Oh, Ganguly! Did you trick me again? - No sir, he gave his underpants. - Underpants! Sir, we are right outside the hospital gate. We will take over from here. - Bye. - Bye. Tata Docomo! Hey, that is Ganguly! - Let us run! - Shut up, follow him! Shut up, chase him! Come on, chase him! Some douche is following us. Faster! He is the same guy who was following us in the hospital. - Douche. We must kill him. - No, we must not be seen by anybody. - You drive faster. - Faster! Faster! Faster, man. Why are you going this way when he is going that way? Did you take the shortcut? Hand him over to me gracefully. Oh, my God! They have guns! Let us run from here. They have guns! - We have stones. - So what? What does a madman do with stones? - He smashes people's heads with it. - Take this. - So, you mean I am mad? - Do we have to state the obvious? Hit him! - Not me, at them! - Here we go. Oh, God! They're throwing stones! -The stones have run out, Rama -And so has the story, Uncle. - How? - Like this! - Now, look. - Where? - There. - Why? Damn. We will die! Let's get out of here. Run! Thank goodness. They are gone. - Where to? - Tarzan. Did you want to escape from Chari's grasp? You? How the hell did you escape? Don't you feel any shame in saying that? No, sir. They used the latest weapons. You failed to utilize the available resources to apprehend a criminal. - Are you doubting me, sir? - You are making me doubt you. - Well... - No more explanations! You have brought shame and disgrace to the department. Excuse me, sir! As long as I'm here, we'll never be ashamed. Hey, what is your job here? Get out. Hold on! Do not over speed. I came to inquire if you obtained any clues from the criminal I handed over to you. - Who the hell are you to ask? - Chari. Ramachari. Crime Investigating Detective, sir! - That criminal escaped. - Oh, my God! What are you saying? Did Chadda, the sincere officer, let the criminal slip away? No... This is not a normal shame. It is puppy shame! But don't worry, sir. Be happy. Like always, I am here to save the reputation of the department. - Why? Are you surrendering on his behalf? - Yes! I mean, no! Coming. Here's the criminal who got away from you! I mean, the one who escaped. Despite being insulted several times, you saved the reputation of the department. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, sir. This is our first victory after the establishment of Chari & Co! - Mr. Chari. Congrats. - Thank you, sir. ♣Get ready for the police recruitment process. I'll put in a good word for you. Not required, sir! I have unfinished tasks to address before joining the department. - You need any help? - I need a photograph. - Mine? - Ours! After our first successful case, we would like to hang the photo on the wall. Pasupu. Write the news. Flash it all over! The criminal who escaped from custody was skillfully caught by CID Chari & Co. You write this down! Come to this side. Excuse me, sir, please. Please hand over the cases to Chari & Co, which you are unable to solve. - Affordable fees and better results! - Affordable fees and better results! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Mr. Chadda... - Sir! send him for a narco test. The truth will be unveiled by itself. Yes, sir. C.I.D. CHARI & CO Boss. We have a case! She is not a case. She is my one side love. Why is she coming to this side? Maybe "her" side has feelings now. If you make way, she'll come to my side. Hi! - Hey, hi! - Congratulations! Why? Most people blame their luck... if they don't achieve their goals and go into depression. Some even commit suicide. But you always find alternatives to reach your goal. - I like your attitude. - Thank you. You always find an alternative to reach your goal. Then why are you not looking for alternatives in love? - Love and goal are not the same things. - Then? Goals are born here. Love is born here. You have an alternative for everything that is born here. But things born here, die here! You and I are getting married A Wedding! Marriage, extravagance, celebrations All over the place I would say I am ready I will offer you my elegance I will come with you without questioning I will make merry in mess Come, I am ready Let us hurry up and start the fun Come, I am ready Let us go crazy No worries anymore You and I are getting married A Wedding! The warmth that is Inducing craving in you Creates the effect Of moon and jasmine in me Your golden curves Your flawless complexion? Aggravating the intoxication in me Makes me follow you You asked me to come, so tell me How do you want me to come? After I realized you are my doll How do I stay only ogling At you from a distance? Come, I am ready Let us go crazy No worries anymore Come, I am ready Let us hurry up and start the fun You are carved out of the stars You give me immense joy Let me pull your cheeks once You have the right To pull my petal-like cheeks Break the boundaries of my shyness Stay by my side My feelings aggravates When you run like that towards me You make me want to run this way You taught me how to do this to you Come, I am ready Let us hurry up and start the fun Come, I am ready Let us go crazy No worries anymore You and I are getting married A Wedding! - Hey, make the rounds! - Okay, sir. - You guys too. Go. - Okay, sir. Do not worry. Mukesh Bhai told me everything. - You run away. - What about the Commissioner? You do not worry about all that. You leave! Thank you! He fled when I tried to kill him. But his escape led to his own demise. Sir? We need a reason for his encounter. - Sir. - Please, sir. Excuse me. Please, one by one. There are a lot of doubts regarding this encounter. What do you have to say about that? I didn't kill a commoner or a social worker. I killed a criminal. Is that clear? What is the reason behind his encounter a day before his narco test? He attacked the police while trying to escape. We had to fire back in self-defense. My officer also got injured. Please make a note of that. This is all fake! - Say something, sir. - Please, sir. In an attempt to suppress this case, the police staged a fabricated encounter, resulting in the loss of a crucial witness. It is a disgrace to the police! This is undoubtedly a planned murder. Commissioner had tried to kill this witness before as well. The police authorities have seen it themselves. If I say anything more... The Commissioner just might kill me in the middle of the night. You rascal! This is not the right time. Leave him. To keep him or fire him, is the decision of the government. This case should be given to the Citizen Rights Commission. - Commissioner Chadda. - Must be suspended. - Commissioner Chadda. - Must be suspended. This guy is going overboard because Giri is lenient. You failed to catch Ganguly. You are inefficient! How did you know that I failed to catch Ganguly? Intellect! - Intellect? - Yes. - Intelligence by birth? - No, I stole it from somebody's purse. Did you steal it from somebody's purse? Are you a thief? I am anybody, but Ganguly. Yeah. Why didn't you react when he was provoking? I want to shoot an entire magazine into his body. But I cannot do anything to him! The department already suspects me. We'll get caught if we do anything to him. We need to stay quiet until this operation concludes. But we will get rid of him somehow. Sir, Chari & Co company is operating without a valid license. Sir, what are you doing? Hey! How dare you run an office without a license? This is our first and last warning. Ask him to stay within his limits! This is it. We must inform the IG and file a complaint against the Commissioner. We are running this office without a license. If they file a complaint, we will be in a mess. The CM is visiting the Mother Teresa Orphanage tomorrow. We will meet him directly. MOTHER TERESA ORPHANAGE - Long live! - Mr. CM. - Long live! - Mr. CM. Okay, sir. Mr. CM is here. - Long live! - CM Harishchandra Prasad. - Long live! - Mr. CM. - Long live! - CM Harishchandra Prasad. - Hey, why are you not going? - Can't you see why? - No, my glasses are blocking my view. - Oh, my blind uncle, the gunmen will shoot us! Sir! Welcome sir. Hey! This way, sir. Please come. - Long live! - Mr. CM Damn it, a bomb! What is with you?! Hey... I will break your head! You want a smaller one? What is he trying to do? - I will shove it up your... - Oh, my God! - Long live! - Mr. CM - Long live! - Mr. CM Hey! - Sir... - You guys stop. Sir, I need to talk to you. Please, sir. To talk, come to the office. Don't embarrass yourself by falling at my feet in public. Sir, if I don't meet you now, I won't have another chance. Hey, take him away! - You wanted to tell me about... - This matter, sir. I asked you to wait for a minute to save your life. Sir, are you okay? I am fine. You go check the others! The one who saved the CM... - Long live! - CID Ramachari! The one, who came like an angel... - Long live! - CID Ramachari! - Hey! Stop it. - Long live! - What's this? - CID Ramachari! It is my responsibility as a citizen to save our CM. You do not have to do all this. I don't like it. - Uncle! - Yes, dear. - Thank you, uncle. - Thanks to you too. Thank you, Chari! I am not thanking you because you saved my life. I am appreciating you - for saving the future of these kids. - Thank you, sir! One more thing, if you want any sort of help in the future. Come directly to me! - Thank you, sir! - See you. Thank you very much, sir! Hello, Mr. Chadda! On a good day, even bomb blasts favor you. You demolished my office. And I made the CM fall for me! You asked me if I were a hero to save the CM's life that day. Yes, indeed. I am not just a hero in the CM's eyes but in the entire state! - Chari. Ramachari. - He is a great detective! Boys, follow me. RAMACHARI'S ADVENTURE SAVES CM'S LIFE Chari! - Who the hell is Chari? - He is a private detective. You douche, you're unable to deal with a private detective. How will you kill the CM? Now, I will do it myself. - Call Chari here. - Okay, sir! Stop showing off! What's with this action movie-like build-up? We must do this, as we are Chari & Co! - Who is going to pay the bills? - My grandson's great-grandfather? Grandson's grandfather? Who would that be? My father's son-in-law. My father's son-in-law. You mean? Damn it, that is me! After your return from Delhi... Sir, Mr. Chari is here. Come Chari. - Hello, sir. Ramachari. - Hello. - Kotachari! - Tatachari! - Who are these people? - He is my father. - And he is my brother-in-law. - He is my son-in-law. - Mr. Commissioner! - Sir! - Please. - Sir? Make way, they will take a seat. Everybody in my college canteen is discussing Chari. Child! They must be talking about charu or sambar. You kids, go inside. - Mr. Chari. - Sir. - Only one of you respond to me. - Okay, sir. Will you guys let me talk? How did you know there was a bomb in my car? We discovered it only after the explosion! Sir, Chari found out beforehand. We got to know later. - Who is behind that blast? - Those who want to kill you! We know that. But who are they? Some secrets cannot be disclosed until they are confirmed, sir. All the details will be revealed at the climax. - Okay, Mr. Chari. - Sir! - You have done a good job. - Thank you very much, sir. - I have a small request. - Tell me, Chari. - Please let me have a gun, sir. - Gun?! Yes, sir. Just one gun. Please, sir. It's not a toy that can be handed over to anybody! It's a gun! - Ask for something else. - I just want a gun. - You think this is funny? - No, sir. After saving your life, your enemies have become my enemies. Sir, is it wrong to request a gun for self-defense? Excuse me, sir. Giving a revolver to a civilian will cause major problems for us. - He saved my life. - Yeah! Only on one condition. You are allowed to shoot only under the knee just in case you have to shoot. Sure, sir. Hold on. Let me put some cotton. If you put the cotton there. You will reach the heavens! Oh, sorry. I just have a small doubt. What will happen if you fire at this height? Head! - A little down. - Heart! - A little further. - Stop. Apples! Stop messing around. If you guys keep fighting, how will I shoot? Right. When will you shoot? You have only been aiming for two days! He's new to this. Let him aim. When will he fire? Fire! I am about to shoot. I am about to shoot. I have shot! There. The apples have exploded! Am I leaking? - Yes! - Good job, my boy! Lizards shouldn't be by your side but rather a wife. - Whose wife? - His wife. - When did he get married? - After he gets married. Stop it, Dad. Why would I get married so early? - Why are you pointing the gun at me? - Why are you opening my clothes? - Hey, Chari. You have a gun in your hand. - Yes! - You have a car to roam around. - Yes! - You got all the money you want. - Yes! Now we just need someone to light a lamp at home now. Why? Is my mother refusing to light? Chari! For how long will you stay single? - But, Dad... - Listen, Chari... A gun without bullets is no different from a man past his prime. - Useless! - That we can tell just by looking at you. Meeting with Gita for marriage tomorrow! Is there anything you would like to ask the girl? Why not? A chain for the neck and a waist belt! She is my wife-to-be. Your sister! Please look for an auspicious date, priest! - Please give me their horoscopes. - We do not have his horoscope. There's another scope. Want me to get it? Shut up. You rascal! - What is the name of the boy? - Dokka Ramachari. - Dokka...? Ramachari! - Ramachari! - Date of birth? - Nineteen... A call! What's with the delay? Come fast. I cannot come, son! Come to the building next to Bloomfield, near Lanco Hills. Uncle, why? I apprehended the playwright behind the conspiracy against the CM! Really? With a personality like yours? It is not the personality, it is the willpower that matters. You come right away. - Your date of birth? - I will tell you. Come on. Why is he fleeing when I inquired about his date of birth? He is a little shy. I reckon he is quite old too. - Tata? - Uncle? - Tata? - Uncle? - Tata! - Uncle... Can you pick up on someone's moans? Somebody must be at it... Let's go and watch a free show. - Uncle! - Tata! Uncle, what happened? I thought you caught the criminal. Why don't you answer us?! - Sorry... - Sorry. At first, I tied him up. He wanted to pee, so I untied him. Then he grabbed and tied me up! - You should have unzipped him instead! - I had tied him upside down! - Anyway, where is he? - There. He is running away. - Uncle, he is a mad guy. - He is a criminal in disguise! He was present wherever the CM went. - Uncle, you are a genius! - And me? You are a joker! If we apprehend him, the case is solved! - Guys! - Yes. - Let's go! - Come on!

Come with me. It is really nice there! - Jai Hind! - Let's go. He is mad, son. - Is he? - Yes. We wasted so much time running after him. He is mad? - You still did not realize? - Give him one, dude. - Uncle, come this way! - Why? Oh, bro! Hands off me, douche! Hey... Stop. Look how he is chasing him. - Son, come back. I am hungry! - He is the killer. He's the killer! Hey, follow him! Sir, that Ramachari... He is following you. I know. What should I do, sir? You must avoid being caught by him. Run... He is running too fast. I am afraid he might catch me. Sir, please do something and save me. Do not look back. Keep running. Faster... How much longer must I keep running? Please do something, sir. Stop there! He has a gun, sir. I will shoot you! He cannot shoot you in public. Keep running. Run! He won't shoot. Keep running. - Down! - Okay. Die! Mr. Commissioner! What is going on here? Sir, let me explain. This guy has too much attitude, sir. Is he a police officer to shoot anybody in public? He shot this guy like a hunter guns down a bird! That is why I was against giving him a gun. He was a criminal, sir. So, you will shoot him? I told you the conditions. I aimed at his knee, sir. It hit his head by mistake! No more explanations! File a case against him and throw him in jail. Right, sir. Damn, you! What? You just asked to throw a file in jail. - God, you are so dumb. - Police report is ready, sir. - Giri! Flask is ready, Giri. - I do not want tea now. Not that flask. I meant the fax is ready. - Listen. Release him. - Sir! Congratulations, Chari. You shot one of the most wanted criminals. He has a reward of 25 lakhs on his head. - What are you talking about? - Read it properly, sir. They must have written 25 years in prison and not a reward of 25 lakhs. Shut up! - Sorry, Chari. - It's okay, sir. Are you hurt? The Commissioner must be more hurt than me! Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner. With your ongoing help, I'll keep achieving monumental feats. Thank you! Greetings. - Bro-in-law! - Sir! - Wait, Bro-in-law... - What, Bro-in-law? - You dint give me dowry, right? - Right. - You'll get 25 lakhs as a reward, right? - Yes. Why don't you give me my share of it? Here we go. - What? A rupee? - You don't want it? - No. - Okay! - Oh, Brother-in-law. - Yes. Can you show me someone with a 25-lakh reward? I will shoot him and get the reward. - Really? - Yes. - There, shoot him! - Who? Him. Hey, Bro-in-law! How dare you call me your brother-in-law? Oh, no! Not you, sir. Hello. - Sir, my name is Gita. - Tell me. I know the guy who was killed by Ramachari yesterday. Call the Commissioner. Drag him out. - We do not know anything, sir. Leave us. - Keep walking. I beg you, sir. Why disturb people in the vicinity of residential areas? They are not families. They are the ones who gave refuge to the most wanted criminals. No, sir. - Grandma! What is this? - Oh, God! Sir, she is Chari's girlfriend. What's this? - Why are you arresting her? - Leave that old lady. - Get the girl instead. - Sir? Let's go. Sign these papers. What is it? Documents confirming your association with terrorists. Why would I call you, if I were with them, sir? Sign the papers! Hey! So, you are Ramachari's lover? Not bad. He has decent taste. Shall I... taste you myself? Just once. Hey! Sir, she gave refuge to the terrorists. Then he assaulted me and other officers before forcibly taking her away. That means Ramachari is also associated with them, for sure. Failing to arrest them despite knowing everything is an insult to my uniform. Arrest him! TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS The CM personally authorized us to catch the one who can potentially save him. Is it a non-bailable warrant? No, shoot at sight order. Sir?! Got it, sir! Munni got defamed For you, my darling... Yes, Mukesh Bhai. Up until now, you haven't been able to even harm the CM. But brother... I am not here to listen to your rubbish. I am going to kill the CM tomorrow. The CM is heading to Vikarabad for a town hall event. In the afternoon, he will take a rest at the R&B guesthouse. R & B GUESTHOUSE VIKARABAD I will do the job myself. I just need your help. Hey, Home Minister... Remember... I will not spare you! You are going to die when we meet next! Only divine intervention can unite us with the CM in a demon-infested place like Lanka. - Is he not enough? - Who? This mad fellow? Kids and mad guys are equivalent to God! - Equivalent to God! - What is he going to do? - Burn down Lanka! - Give me a round of applause. So he is Lord Anjaneyulu? I will smash your face! Lanka was set ablaze by Hanuman. - Anjaneyulu or Hanuman? - I don't know for sure! - Even I do not know for sure. - Bloody! - Here, take this too. - Go ahead. If you were to die in this conflagration, will you remember us? I'll die, become a ghost, torment you, cause your demise, and repeat the cycle of death. Fire my tail! I am Hanuman! The one who set Lanka ablaze! I am Hanuman! The one who set Lanka ablaze! I am Hanuman! The one who set Lanka ablaze! I am Hanuman! The one who set Lanka ablaze! Sir! Oh, Chari! Sir, I came to clarify something. I have no connection with the conspiracy against you... I know. I made a hasty decision. Sir? Mukesh, the leader of the terrorists, is the one attempting to kill me. When I served as Home Minister, I took action to counter-terrorism. I got Mukesh arrested. The system is targeted by terrorism, and I stand against terrorism. As a result, I had to pay a huge price. As part of the conspiracy to free Mukesh... they had kidnapped my daughter. My country or my child? Without any second thoughts, I stood in favor of the country. But... Now I fall short in assuming the role of my grandchildren's mother. Even now, I am ready to die for this country. Even if I give my life, that... Oh, no. Mukesh! Hey! Sir! Is the job done? That douchebag Ramachari once again interrupted the task. Hey, Varaprasad! That Ramachari shot the CM and is taking him away. Follow him! - Hey, run away! - But why? - Has the plan failed? - What did the CM say? Hey, stop screaming! Get in the car. Uncle, come fast. Take care of the cabbage. Do not damage! Damn. I cannot do it anymore. The joints are devoid of grease. The body is devoid of glucose. If only I had a Benz. Party symbol of Annagaru! Hey, my cycle! Oh, God! Mr. CM? Greetings, sir. Sir. The facilities in the jail are not good enough. That poor quality rice is an injustice to the prisoners. Hey! He is unconscious! Did you kill him? Shut up! What happened was... Why are you getting tense about this? If we go and hand him over to the cops, they will leave us and catch them. If we tell them the truth, they will arrest us. - If he tells the truth? - They will felicitate us. Let us get felicitated. Let us save his life first! - Brother! - What? Cops! - They are coming here? - Yes. They are getting close. Do something. Quick! - Here. Take these eggs. - Why eggs? Sunday or Monday. Eggs never fail you. That is a brilliant idea here. I dedicate this one to you. Why plain dosa? I asked for an egg dosa. Here is your egg dosa. You... Sachin's googly! Good one, Ganguly! - Bro, we're out of weapons. - Here, take the Vishnu discs. Ice-cream facial. Rub it. Feels like flying in the hair Like heart's sudden explosion Feels like someone hit The beehive with a stone Oh, God! Subham! Your wife is eloping! Oh, no! Here, catch it. Here, one to your right. One to your left. Catch it, come on. Catch it! This is Venkatesh's "dharma wheel." This is Prabhas's ordinary wheel. This is Lokesh's, this is mine, and this is Sainik Chakra. This is Nara Chandrababu Naidu's... Hey, dude. Bye! Rama. You have fooled me! Good morning, sir. - Hey, why are you throwing the plates? - Just like that. For fun. Help me get down, sir. - We will show you what fun is! - Come to the police station. I'll showcase Chari's car power now. Let's begin the show. Here is magic number one! Hit the marbles! You guys will topple! Now magic number two! Smoking is injurious to health! Hey, stop! Now magic number three! Chilly powder spray! - That must be your husband. Quick, run! - Action beneath the grass. Magic number four! Indian oil will spoil your life. Sorry, brother. Sir, endure a little longer. We will reach the hospital in five minutes. Please, sir. Hey, stop there! Throw the gun! Throw the gun! Hands up! Chari gives in, and CM's ascent will begin. Ramachari. He is a great detective. Now, the two of you will die like dogs. What's wrong with him? Hey, Chari. What is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind? North India mafia king! Crazy bugger. I will kill your CM. Looks like he's gone mad. Where's my pistol? Oh, my! Hey! Mukesh Bhai? Hey, Commissioner! Mr. Dramachari, greetings! Sorry! Rama... Mr. Ramachari. How are you doing? - Hands up! - I am Commissioner Chadda, don't forget. Then, attention! Stand at ease! Attention! Stand at ease! Stand at ease! Attention! Salute! No... Up. Down. Now as you like! Left, right... About turn! Run! - No... - Why? You plan to shoot me? I won't run! - Hey, Chari. What are you doing? - Nothing, sir. Just like that. For fun. Hey, Chari! Whether you're a Commissioner or a commoner, the bullet that enters is identical, and we all bleed the same blood. Chadda! CID CHARI, WHO SAVED THE CHIEF MINISTER WITH HIS ABILITY AND INTELLIGENCE... WILL BE SENT TO SCOTLAND BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT FOR TRAINING - Bye! - Bye! - Son! - What? Arjun! Come on, Arjun! Come on! Hey! Good boy! Arjun, sit carefully. We're on a plane. - Welcome, sir. - Thank you. - You?! - Yes. Shall we go? - Where? - Up! Listen, crazy guy! That seat is meant for the pilot! You called me crazy? I'll teach you a lesson! Hey! Stop this! I don't want to go! I'm not saying goodbye! The crazy guy is in here! Stop it! Stop it, bro! - No! No! - How does that feel? He took off! Hey, stop it! Please! This is not a shared taxi ride! You can't stop wherever you want! We won't stop at Koti Center. Hussain Sagar is here. Should I stop? You will stop at Hussain Sagar? You freak! Hey, I'll find my way to Scotland on my own. But you all can head home with a big smile and return tomorrow. More laughter, bright smiles. Yours truly, Ramachari!
