After a year of waiting for him and he's gone the first time that happened. Excuse me, but if. Silence. Well, you see, ma'am, I'm a bit like a commuter from prison. My grandfather, on the other hand, was on a permanent basis. Look, spare me the history of your family. E. He knows Formula One sweats come. Mia, What the hell am I going to kill myself? Oh, but he doesn't get mad. Ah, I understand. Other than heat, this is heat, it's something we like to get ex-convicts. The Shrewd Widow. Look how expensive it is. Oh no, then it's time to pay the lady. What. Does? Come here. Look at me here. I just wanted to see if it still worked for him. And it worked. Or the backrest calls me a continuous hit. And then after a year in prison. Then it's all right. You remember Ines Badoer, in art, if what? can you? to say. Ines PU? Ines, what happened to that big whore? And did she marry my brother? Ecco. I am the Countess Magda Buscaroli widow closet. Spaghetti Bud macaroni. Exact. Coupons. You see, I need you to sleep with Ines like this. No, I know very well that you were Ines's lover in the past. If that's why I've been looking for it. I, I wonder why he wants so? good to his brother. Forget it, this doesn't concern you. You mind the point. That is, Agnes, know that there are 10 million for you, if you will provide me with proof of the fact. No, no, no, no! I want to see clearly. Those 10 million to fuck Ines. What's underneath? I already told you it doesn't concern you. You will report to the villa tomorrow. I've already prepared everything. He will introduce himself as chauffeur and butler. Clear? Clear? Buy yourself a decent uniform, please. By the way, a small detail would be better if you pretend to be a little effeminate. Pederast too. It's not like your brother tells me. But no, don't worry, he's paralysed, but you see, he's very jealous of Ines and so? if he he has no suspicions his task will be easier. I understand. She goes well, look what hunger does. The address? There he is. And now come down. She's out. But how does he leave me here? But it's better that they don't see us together. Away, away from what are these that all extravagant, huh? Ma finir�. He will think about whether we screw you over with politics. But what stuff! Allows. Here are the sun I would prepare that sing. But before tonight some asshole I'll just tell me I find. Thanks nun. What did I tell her? My sister worries, she can't stay at home, but she always waits on sidewalk. Until we meet again. Finally, I've been looking for you there all day. Hi Gege. Thank you. Where are you today? And who was that whore in black? But nothing, it's an inter-family espionage job. If so? this time instead of giving you a year in prison they give you ten.

Mmmmmm. And so, dear monsignor, do you see France as a central country? I've read in the papers that the streetwalkers in your country are in a state of agitation, they are occupying the churches, in short, want official recognition, a register, a register professional. Here, ladies, buy the bulldozer factories on duty. Even here I meant Mr. Conte exquisitely. Monsignor does not understand Italian very well. He wanted news of that spaghetti contract. For colleges. Tell Monsignor to be absolutely calm, because Count Caroni's word only one But what a good heart you have! How much charity do you do. Zietto. Shut up, Bone! I don't want an extra-parliamentarian in my house. But no, darling, the baby just meant that you. You have taboos. I know exactly what he meant. And an anarchist, a scoundrel, a revolutionary, a subversive who spits in the plate where he eats. Don Liborio I made him the sweet that he likes. Ah, what a welcome surprise. No? It's a sin of gluttony. I hate this dessert. Bring my usual Fernet Branca. Please Please. San Benedetto del Tronto. Sweet I'm sorry, I lost my balance. When have you ever had balance?

Marco All longhaired If he doesn't stop fucking with doing housework. All. And for your own good. Cretin. Is it possible you don't understand? You have to make desserts for. The old man, not for Don Liborio. What do you think you gain? The halo for heaven? He had asked for it, he had given it to me. You must take care of the Conte according to their care. Make yourself indispensable. You know very well that if I give him a piece cos? of confidence he takes it cos?. And you give it to him, give him the confidence. What are you doing? The picky one? You want or you don't want. What do you leave something in your will? Yes, but do you know that you are vicious? These too plot. They are sunsets, everyone plots here - it's a family vice. I don't know. Mo what are you doing to me? My God, I repent. Mea culpa, Mea culpa, Mea maxima culpa. Eh, but always happy prayers Throw a blasphemy, otherwise you become too pure and instead to stop in heaven you enter orbit. Hello beautiful lady countess. Just her I wanted. I have the impression that he took his role as butler a little too seriously. Eh, I try to do my best. He succeeded very well, for? I remind her that I had her hired with a ben purpose necessary. And that's exactly what I want to talk to you about. I think we need a little tweaking to our tweaking agreement. In what sense? Well, those 10 million you promised me to copulate with your sister-in-law, well, given the stakes, they seem a bit few to me. But are you crazy? The one who asks me for a huge amount has taken me for a billionaire. She doesn't, but her brother does. And what would this retouching consist of? 30 million allows, madam countess, a little job from before, eh? Rascal, Blackmailer! Ma'am, he didn't pick me up in an orphanage. But I kill her.

You never change whore chicory And when he treats my cockroach sister badly e. It's fine with her. But what need was there to rage with that poor creature Marco? I dislike that one because he's a wanker. Haven't you seen what pallor, what dark circles? But let's stop talking about them. Undress. Show Bruna what I've done. Solo 50. Little offers. But let's start again. Why do you know it hurts you? Every effort, every emotion can be dangerous. But what. Ass! Do you remember what the doctor said? You are right, you are right. I am a wretch. I am unable to resist the temptations of your flesh, of your beauty. What are you saying? I love you and I want you alive. No, no, I want to die. I want to die. But first I deserve a punishment, a humiliation. Come on, come here, come here. Stretch the foot, stretch the pelvis. I have to kiss you. To kiss. You come. I told you 1000 times. I don't like these unnatural things. And then you get ticklish, you know. Ugly unworthy bitch, But even a poor man you deny me And I should leave you all mine money. E vabb�. May. But if you feel bad then, too bad for you. Dear you are dear. Don't worry, come here. My dearest sweet woman, Come. Come with me. Which I tried. Are we love? Yes, where do you find a woman like me ready to satisfy your every need. Whims, any casino dear, in any casino will find him? I. But why were you so late? I am increasingly afraid, it seems to me that everyone is watching me. And then if the rope breaks, you know what a bang! Don't think about it, It's here there. Your auntie who makes you fearless. I'm look, don't you want to touch your aunty? Do you like it? Do you like your aunt? Do you like music? Tell me you like it. All. Where are you going? The good thing if it doesn't do it's always all me doing. Something and it is not said that I am. But also. Oh no. By now I understand. S?, s?, s?, scriver?. It was Tizio. Where do you know who it is who shouted It's me. I'm on the balcony. Before talking about movies come inside. Do you know that I'm afraid to be alone? Yes, dear, I'm seeing. Have you allowed, Madam Countess? Lady Countess. Lady Countess. Or I I I. I I I I I I I I I I I I I instead yes? There. An immense tragedy but that drives you crazy. Hello she asks me ignorant how dare you? Oh well, I've gotten fat, I have a mustache and some gray hair, but don't say that you don't recognize me, stop it. Look at him shoveling smuggler stuff from Val Brembana, which is worse than ai cavalli. Sleeping. Rubber. For? stop it, stop it, I can't stand it. It's a family vice, you know? And stop it, you asshole. Ah, there she is my darling in. Years have passed, but the class is still the same. You are wrong. And everything changed. You are a servant and I am a countess. No, as a countess, you are always my dear, sweet, unforgettable for me. Ines forgets the past, but rather by a little. How long has it been since you crossed over to the other side? Stupid, I wouldn't have believed it. I looked for you because I've always loved you, huh? Do you remember how good we were together? Bene. But if around we were starving. It wasn't night in bed. Come on, how can you resist with that old you eager, always ready, caliente, demanding? Shall we do stuff? No. I've discovered that sex isn't everything. You won't believe this, but I love my husband. Sometimes it's a bit abrupt, though. For? he has a heart of gold. You always liked them, huh? You said to me too that I had it in gold, No, the heart, eh, you're right Ines, the sex that's not all. All right. If after. All right, you. I pray for? art eh, you know. Couldn't you have gotten your wife to push this contraption? I have lots of things to do. Always break that stupid exit on the balcony last night I caught cold, ache belly you could warm it. You be careful, come on. You know why I want more respect for myself and my wife. And then you could have let Giacomo push you. I don't let a queer push me back and then I sent him to bring the breakfast to Ines in bed. Come here. The wolf loses its fur but not the vice. You have lost neither one. He plays well but runs away from him. Oh well, when I went to the beach. Where do I go under the bed, in the closet. L? in the bathroom, in the bathroom, if there is one. Window like you, I'm jealous of the bathroom. I go out the window like predators. Of love and pain. But the pain hasn't gone away yet. Ouch. Ha? Ah, that hurt, huh? Ah! Oh, poor thing, maybe you caught too much cold tonight. And escaped through the window. Mr. Conte, how can I explain to you? In this era, in the space age. No one buys sacred objects, holy pictures, candles anymore. Who knows what the Italians will do with the money. But it looks like they're buggers. All their money in spending money. Electric light. Telephone. Carne. What is thunder? For me it's a wave that comes a wave. We're not at the sea. Don't say stupidity. You are Count Giosu� Caroni. S?. And twenty years ago we would have been Hotel Splendid, do you remember that? S?, vent'anni fa. Sanremo. Yes, sure, I seem to remember. It was an unforgettable vacation. A wonderful, wonderful, fun time. She didn't look like a girl to me then. I am ironic. I wasn't sitting stuck in this wheelchair. Then he remembers Bianca slashing wolves. White that. Slash wolves. You met her one evening at the casino?. He had lost everything and she generously helped him. Oh, s?, s?, s?. Now I remember it. Bianca Sure, she was a beautiful woman. They had operated on her at Laurent and I lost her money. You offered money to a woman. It was a loan, a loan. He gave them back. No, she couldn't and he demanded to sleep with her for six months. Isn't it? No, yes. It was quite a funny story. She didn't want to, but I was adamant about certain things. No exceptions. A loan is a loan. And you got the interest paid too, didn't you? Maybe she won't believe it, but after a few days I didn't think about that money story more really, because I really liked Bianca. I loved her and I even wanted but. Then one day she became pregnant. And it disappears without a trace. I've looked for it everywhere. No no no no, no, no it hadn't evaporated, I couldn't find it anymore. Yes, that's right, they volatilize. Because he was afraid that she would make her have an abortion. But how does she know all these things? Why was I born after a few months, Count? I'm his daughter. My daughter? Oh, my daughter! Oh, the heart! Oh carit�! Look at the state he's put us in. She has no evidence to prove what she claims. With this system all the bastards of Italy could show up here. Thank you Madam. Too easy, too comfortable. If he wants money, we'll give it to him, as long as he goes away. But what vulgarity! My husband is stoned, but not to the point of believing her. Stoned you will be. Pap�. Dad. A case. Precisely. So you also think that this slut is a stimulator? Isn't that right, dear? Could but. But he knows too much about my past, too many details, you know? However there is an infallible sign to recognize where our family means this maybe. Rosi Bindi sends approached to her and let's see if they are equal in her. Then they will certainly not be the same. Oh, now it's time to. Dry Marzio. Down the breeches. Just let's go, miss. I'm doing it for the Count who's sick, his little ass is already sticking out of one hand. Are you okay with it? What will it be? I've done it many times. Oh, me. Ouch, ouch ouch ouch! There is some neoprene in this story. All equal. Have you ever seen this? perfect. What do you think, father? To me they look exactly the same. And you, James? They look the same. For? if they allow me, Signorino Marco's is the finest. Are they the same or not? identical? I'm not at all sure. And then they are the same. Come, my daughter, Come. Pap�. We have so many things to tell each other. Exit and. Everyone get out. I want to be alone with my baby. Honey, why didn't you come earlier? Why didn't your silly mother bring you here to me? Why was he afraid? Fear of what? What if all hell? And then he never told me who my father was until the last moment? She's dead. He left me this for you, read it. Will I read it? later alone. You will be here with me now, in this house which is now yours too. We have lost a lot of time, but the desire regaining everything together with you, with mine girl. The good James is good. There is nothing in front of you, there is a deserted garden. There's nothing else in front of you. And now take a green lighter. With Dessena and her juice cocktail. Thank you. Man mano ognuno yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo yo. But I wouldn't be embarrassed, would I? And what effect does it have on you? Ah, nobody. Look at nobody. Well, to avoid accidents I cover myself. Here's what we're good at. Ho I I I, I, I, I. I, I I, I, I, I I. What happens to you? Are you excited? I? What does Contessina say? No, I was just thinking Eh, I said, eh, if I had a body like yours, the world would conquer. Do you see the world O yo yo yo yo, did I say? I believe so. Di s?. On. But soon soon or. Now the desire. To have 1. Minute, she takes you by the hand. It's Berman. Not. a. Slowly we have a plan, one. Now you are what the man wants, nothing else that this man that this man. A man has a passion. The.

And then the bomb is mine, Give me back the bomb, give me back the bomb. Not me. After. But after that, what are you doing. Miss? The fact that my husband made the foolishness of recognizing her as daughter does not authorize him to behave in an indecent manner. Yes, get dressed, ma'am, get dressed. And you don't water anymore. My nephew is of a frail constitution. I see that today you feel like playing baby. Save all this strength for tonight. These. Also. We have to. Ah! Marco you are crazy, I'm crazy there.

Kill, I won't kill you! I'll break your femur on the walls, I'll send you to the emergency room. Can you hear me and tell me you can hear me. Of course what do I feel? You're shouting in my ear. If you continue like this? he hears you too. Oh, the Bondone, the Falzarego! I'm doing the Giro d'Italia. Let's go well. Be better. Also because I took an oar in prison that hurts like Our Lady. What assholes will I also have?. Like once upon a time Ines. Car you are always there and. Se. Do you remember Maddalena while we were making love, aren't you one of the castanets? He never crashed his balls inside the castanets. Ah yes, nice. What great pain! Oh, what moments! No no. But if we go by gondola, bitch. You are dreaming? Not so! Ha ha ha! But in Correggio you toyed with the idea. What? this picture is nice! Since I have found things that I really like. You have it in your hands, He's touching my ass. It's always a family habit. Here, then give him yours, which is better, huh? Ha ha ha ha no. What a noise Like a dry rose in a forest. This here is annoying. When you're good. Cos?. Ah. How beautiful! Do you remember in San Sebastian when they used to ride on the beach? Other times. More rides. Silence. Come on, come on, the horse ropes are back again Ah ah! Mmm. Ah! Ah! Hold on, hold on Ines we've arrived. How nice, What a moment then. Then I think about. How happy I am. Eros Now I understand that you still love me And I want to be honest with you. It was Magda who made me come here to the old whore. Well, he wanted me to compromise you over the inheritance. No? And you. No. But don't be stupid. The two of us together will become his plan. You need a man like me, one who has your back. Go away, Giacomo. We'll talk tomorrow. He, poor fellow, so good, would never think I have a lover. In the room of. Do you want me to be Marta's accomplice again? But don't you understand that I love you? I love you. We are together again. Ines. Where does all this mess come from here? Shipwrecked up, huh? How do I know you are telling the truth? Well, the. Truth. You and me forever. But yes, dear, you and I always, for the whole inheritance. For eternity. Oh yes?? Certain. Right, darling. Oh, darling. If this guy at least kept pace with his snoring, he's out of time. Oh! Oh! Oh! My. Countess Magda. I can set myself free, ma'am, go ahead. Excuse me, Don Liborio, can I ask you a dear question? Here, after death, where do the fennel end up? Excuse me, but what kind of question? But no, let her tell you, countess, as long as Giacomo doesn't take offense. But do you think? Well, how? Where do they end up? I am trying to say. In heaven or in hell? Definitely in hell. Ecco. And the fake ones How would it be? Fake yes, those who pretend to be. And who is that madman who pretends to be a fagot? Excuse me, father. Please Please. Well, a little crazy, of course not, huh. It seems to me that if it is an anomalous situation the lie is also added. The sentence can not be that one in hell. Sorry again, Giacomo, not Toffee. But do you think? You can see that fennel is liked au gratin, they send them all to hell. Bene. Too bad that Giacomo is a fagot, because as a man he's not bad at all. Man are you a queer to the top of your hair? However, he should be fired, as the new waitress arrives today. But how is the water? Giacomo Excellent and plentiful like rations. Will you take me on a dinghy ride with joy? It is never possible to eat a piece of bread in peace. Ah well, listen Giacomino, have you ever been there with a woman? With a woman? Well, yes, once, but just barely. But you don't like me? The Countess What should I answer? Of course, I like it very much. But you see, I'm like this? how i see a woman blah blah. Grab like a falling stuff is instead she and. In short, you don't put it that it remains even with a finger. Beh. With a finger maybe, maybe yes, yes. But only with that. That's it, just One finger only. July, July. We? How hot! I take a bath. It's better. Oh. Giacomo, please, put your panties to dry. I was right to take it off. That stuff here is not hot. Eh? Santa Margherita Ligure savage assault without serious injuries. Does a year and six months make nine months worth it for you? The name port is in the void. Morning, gloves, gloves. Radio. His head didn't tell me it was low. Help! Rescue. Emergency room help. Oh, if they were so? kind. But James. I don't know a pederast. No, mom. I am a lesbian pederast. And a new category. Oh. You finally discovered yourself! I haven't been able to lie to myself that he says The lie is not Maria's son. This mischief. Then I understood everything since I saw you with Insa bed. People. Yes, sure. In fact, I also took some beautiful photographs of you. Were you okay? I want to congratulate you. Go strong. Oh God! Oh God! I'm lost from work lost! What do you mean? It's a long story. No, Susy, A little comfort. Life is hard, father. It may be that one day I may need help. Are you, Countess, joking? Do you know how far you can? arrive human wickedness. Even in the family there are enemies. I am so. Only you will be? near me. I don't know what he's talking about, but sar? ready to help her. If you only knew how much good your words do me. If I have any? need. If you need to. I can count on your support. Of course. Moral support and, for that matter. I can, even material. Thank you thank you. If you knew what weight it took off my heart. Of course I will know be grateful for this help. But what are you saying, Countess? Not even as a joke. I am at your complete disposal, selflessly. Now I know that I can count on her. Absolutely. We go back where? With the others? Ah yes. But I never understood everything about your father's money. Not a bad idea, after all. Of course, the legitimate share belongs to me by right, but the bulk of the loot is free. No, but do you like me? I wonder. And would you play a little cheat with me? It's a family vice. And the evidence against me if I already have it. If we can compromise Magda too, Dad will leave everything to me. You understand? I understand, it's a bit unethical, but. Listen to those who talk about morals. In any case, you must decide whether you stay with me or with Magda or with Incalza. But with you. However, always with. A mom or. Dad. I don't know if it's the first time I've made love in apnea. We are six Majorcas of sex with erotomaniac fate. Pearl thing. I came to see if you needed anything. No, it's no use. Thank you. It is true that I would say nothing of what you have seen. For. Good evening, send me the agency. I'm the new waitress. But still touching. I'm afraid to go down. But who touches you? But how? In short, do you want to understand that you can't stay here? I work, there's a big deal on my hands here and if it goes well it's good for both of us. I want to be close to you, I don't want you to get yourself into any other mess. If I have a little time you just go in and out of the prison. In short, you can't stay here. It compromises me. James or not. I'm leaving. Finding you wasn't easy. Luckily a friend saw you driving the count's car. He told me. The sidewalk mafia. Eh well, we are quite connected to each other. Then another friend told me they were looking for a waitress here. These whores are talking. The bad news came later. I ran to the agency but I had no references. But how? If you are famous throughout the region? Yes, but not as a waitress. You don't know what I had to do to get hired? Look, look, don't tell me. Who knows how happy the agency employees were. Oh, that's enough, I'm fed up. I sacrifice myself for you and you treat me like this. Your gratitude is beautiful. How beautiful you are! You look like a lifeguard. But of the beach? Ah beh. Keep, forget that we are made to be wonderfully together, like Mina and Albert Wolf. Alberto Lupo have never been together. I'm in the ignorant table. And then like pasta and beans, like rice and peas. You're so romantic! US Secretary of State Kissinger will travel to the Middle East again with a suitcase full of promises. Apart from this news, I am not interested in politics and economics. I want to go to the news. I want facts of blood, I want fathers, blood. The child is bursting with health. Eight dead. All right. Don't kid me, go ahead. The octogenarian kills his twenty-year-old wife with 60 stab wounds equal to the difference of the years from yesterday. He has a mother Lido, that infamous one does not. It seems that the poor thing was not an expert in cooking. And I'm fine anyway because marriage is a serious matter. You girls do not want to understand, for? i'm. And this is the idea. And the new waitress. I'm Marisa, Mr. Conte's new personal maid. I see it, I see it, I see it. Bene. Very well. I will finally be able to help but see your ugly face. Work. And the newspaper. Give it to her. He will also be able to read. Seller of love choked on a pea. Unintelligent queer found stabbed in a vespasian. At that time. Then what? As? What? What's going on with Ines? Nothing. Nothing. There was nothing to be done, Countess Amalia. Nothing. She says she loves her husband and respects him. I've tried every way. Look, I'm not bragging, but there isn't a woman I haven't taken off underwear. Don't be vulgar. Sorry. However I'm starting to think that it is. That. There are two cases, for? It's really changed. Don't make me laugh. Or suspect something that is in the bell. There is also a third hypothesis. Would be. That you agreed with Ines to screw me over. Madam Countess Magda, how does such a thing suggest? But how? Just me who nourishes a strong feeling of love for her, indeed, indeed, always with due regard. If you allow, before going with your sister-in-law, I can do some training with you she. Madam Countess Malta No slap this time. No slap. But Frau, the Chamber of Labor is not. I I I. I, I, I. I myself. Listen well Giacomo Primo, you will never take my underpants off, too because I don't wear them. According to me, I'll give her another week. After which she packs her suitcase and disappears. It's clear. If he screwed up my balls, I'll. I make cold packs. If I can go, if not I then. Ma. Ah ah ah! Count, how many times do I have to tell you that sweets are bad for him? He must not eat them! And then see if it gets dirty. That's all? Hmm. But don't come, come, I feel all dirty here too. Come closer, Clean yourself well. Now it is perfectly clean. Don't make me continue. Everything here is full of dust. You are right. That blonde that Giacomo never does anything, the one that. But how, didn't you realize it's a fennel? I really don't know much about these things. Nevertheless. For. Joseph. But how is it possible that your age has not yet learned to knock on doors? Maybe the lady countess doesn't want me to dust the birds. You always do as I say, because you are my personal maid. What did you come here to do? What do you want? I'm looking for Mark. He's been missing since this morning. What do you want me to care about that there? who studies the Indian philosophy of work? I thought you sent him on an errand. Yes, there is a commission that I would like him to go to India and die in a bed of nails. But is he your nephew? No, my dear, it's your distraction and you enjoy it if you leave the guest off the ball. Out of here. That woman has to work away. Think Marisa that in this collection of birds. There could be chemistry as much for what it takes. Dust the house, dust, dust. The dance was a miniature. It wasn't even online. Which was still in progress. Sneaker Sneaker. Ah, but is it possible? Every time I go to visit a man I find him already in his underwear. I just took a shower. Only Susanna. Calm calm. First we need to talk about work. Have you forgotten about Magda? Now is the time to compromise it. Yes, yes. Come, let's talk about it on the bed that comes to me. You better not touch me. All right, just undress. In no. We need to talk business first. So what did you decide? What are you going to do? Here, you have to make it harmless, with a good dose of sleeping pill in the carafe of water. What? she falls asleep. But how do I take pictures while she sleeps? S?, cio� no. When? When she sleeps we take her � and breathe all due do we undress her like this? when she's all nicely undressed, look at the stuff. We pose we can put it in all positions we can do whatever we want. Do you like the idea? But she sleeps. But I'm awake and I'm standing on her like this, eh? And no one will ever notice if he sleeps or if he doesn't sleep. The idea is good, but for the sleeping pill I would be able to keep you from noticing it. Don't worry, no one will see me introducing dust into the house. But what are you doing? We need to report. But is it possible that everyone always wants to chat to me? Cecilia Very possible. C'� cos?. Yes. James S?. Continues. Bravo. WITH?. Even less, even if Perdono stops. If still James. Be sex stuff. Ah, what stuff was he saying at that moment. Go slowly, mona, that one hand later I just ate. I'll be good if I don't deflate the tires I'll leave it here alone on the gravel. And witty. But that little pig. Cos?. Crunchy and really so? good what a porridge. It was a really successful birthday lunch. Oh. How were you, sorry? I can sit down? Oh sure, you're welcome. Thank you thank you all thank you all.

I collected them in the garden especially for you. Dad thanks Don Liborio for his silver crucifix. Thank you very much. Small things, white gold.

Glad you command the. Mr. Dash to the bathroom? Yes, sir. I want it to be a wonderful, memorable day for everyone. Don't worry, Marisa, I don't drink much. Here she is. You idiot, you are a bitch! Everyone got him a present on his birthday except the two of us. But what do I have to do with it? And then I didn't understand why you didn't remember it. Sorry, I remember. In this house I always have to remember everything Me, never you. Nothing, Never. Giacomo also remembered to give him a present. Eh. Everyone smart in this house, Everyone except the two of us. Which I know is already like an oven. I have it printed, Mr. Conte. The pasta then be quick. Good. Mr. Conte, what did this letter from the Archbishopric bring for you? It will be Archbishopric. Count, if you arrive at the Archbishopric it is certainly the wishes that it, Your Excellency, the Bishop wanted to address you on this happy occasion. And the Bishop himself, just him. Friend Giosu�, read it. I'm not saying, maybe you pray because I'm without glasses here no, please, read for yourself. Your nephew Marco is in our hands. What?

We will be able to survive against the count himself. towards towards? No, it's not possible. It's not possible! This scholarship is that of the archbishopric. There is also the seal. Someone surely must have replaced the bishop's letter. 10 billion, 10 billion for a ransom. But have we all gone mad? I don't understand a penny. Oh! Signor Conte. But did you read the letter? If the ransom is not paid, that's for starters. Poor Marco will be cut off. And are they fine? he will finally stop jerking off. Giosu�, you could be more delicate. Let's stop this story. There is no shit in the world worth 10 billion. Oh pap�. Yes, dear. We need to see clearly in this story. S?. Call the police. Yes, you are right, my daughter. Call the police, call the police. But you can't. They will kill him right away. They were clear on this point. Count, try to think. Don't waste your words Father, it's in the. Ache. That people know each other. I don't know that man.

But that's better. Thank you guys. You. You're a good girl, you're fond of me, it's obvious you love me. Too bad I'm tied here to this. Ordeal, but I really don't do that. Otherwise the less I play, the more with her. Ed. I'm sure Magda is trying to screw us all. I don't believe this kidnapping story at all. Me niether. Well, so if so? and our plan to compromise it is no longer needed. And then, if the old man pays the ransom, goodbye dreams of glory. We must try to unmask it. Who knows where that idiot Marco must have hidden it? Oh yeah, who knows where that pearl is. Giacomo Contessa takes out the car and takes me to church. Immediately the lady countess. There there there there. It's been three days what can you tell me? Have patience Marco, stay. Don't worry Marco. Don't worry, Marco, but I'm tired of being shut up in here.

Cheer up, cheer up dears, full, drink up, drink up Tommaso cheers, drink up. For?. Magda, I have to tell the truth, that kidnapping idea was brilliant. Do you know that you will not be made just by a hair? On the vague solo and the face. I had a blast with that story. Sorry Magda, but really you would have had the courage to send me a package with hers little thing? My poor Marco! And did you know that while Heidi was toying with you, someone was thinking of cutting them to send them as parcel post? And you, Guinness, are the most wonderful whore I have ever known. Mmmmmmm No, no, dear, for God's sake, don't be offended, it's a compliment. No, true, I say that's why I married you. Sure bringing you a bed lover while I was sleeping was a feat which must be remembered in the history of human reason. One thing. Extraordinary. Oh. And you, Giacomo, do you know that you play the faggot well? You managed to fool us all. Too good. Almost everyone, Almost everyone. Otherwise I combine myself who am always sitting in this wheelchair. The problem is that. Oh then. And you. They are. Oh s?, aside. Mia, P. Cora up. But what stuff! Look at idioms sometimes it's a lot to laugh about. I do not accept, I do not accept. I've never been insulted like this. Wretched bitch, Ora. will I do it? see i. How dare you? I am a. Lady.

Away a bit of calm, a worthy place. Moving house and sex. Giacomo I only learned about it with cannon shots. The lady who was true, goes. But if one doesn't. One in four was enough, you don't know what you're losing. There is a blender. I was already there. Incredible. If someone had told me that one day I would have to leave the house where I was born, I would have had him admitted to an asylum. And your brother who you should have committed to the asylum. You were less busy with everyone than with him who cared so much. It's good for you, but I'm not giving up. grip? the will and I say it. What do you have to hold? You shut up. At least I'm normal. You are the worst of all. What goes to hell? bitch? I can't wait to get out of this house. What drives me mad with rage is that that beggar managed to trick us all. Right from the start. But fuck you! The countess has spoken. Where is the service? Happy and not Emilio Licenziati and Giacomo. For chat. But how did you combine sports? But you're not ready yet.
