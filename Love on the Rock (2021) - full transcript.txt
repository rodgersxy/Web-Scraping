- Mr. Fairbanks, we have a problem. - What just happened? - Sir, the laboratory's been incinerated. - Plaza. She's impulsive, inconsistent and irresponsible. - Stand down, Plaza. We can't risk the serum. Stand down, Plaza. Plaza, can you hear me? Do not shoot. Do not shoot! - We'll find you wherever you are, my little rabbit. - Go ahead. Yes, I see. All right, initiate clearance protocol and reduce the line. And I want updates every hour, starting yesterday. And send them our young one, the one I like. She's ready. - Is he dead? - Christopher! - Hey, you Colton Riggs? This your boat? - No need to yell, it's Malta. No one yells in Malta. Except that guy. - We had a tour booked for St. Paul's Islands and St. Peter's Pool. - For when? - Tuesday. - What day is it today? - Tuesday. - Oh look, honey. It's the famous St. Peter's Pool over there. - Honey, you're doing the captain's job. Let him tell us. - No, no, no, he's doing great. It's actually not Peter's Pool though. That's just around the bend there. - Well whose pool is it anyway? - Great question, hold on. - Malta. Known for its ancient sites and its rich and diverse history that spans from the beginning of time. Example, Valletta. They say really it's a city built by a gentleman or gentlemen. We know of its existence 'cause the night of St. John who constructed it, planned, and built the city. - What's for lunch? My mommy says you're supposed to have lunch for us. - Right. There you go. - Who's this? - It's me, who's it look like? - Not you. What's in it? - Cod and mayonnaise. All right, all right. Hold on. Okay. Peanut butter and jelly. - Ooh. - Hey man, want to talk to you about something. - Is that my shirt? - No, no. Maybe. How you doing, buddy? - Good, man, I'm living the dream. Living the dream. - Dream living. - That's what they say, right? Another charter in the books. - Okay, how many is that now? - I don't know, lost count. - Yeah, I guess you would. All right, well can I get you another one? - No, I'm good, thanks. I'm gonna head out. - Oh you know what, I remember why I came over here. - Why? - Get ready. - I'm not doing this. - Sorry, man. - No, no, no, no, I'm not doing that. - Sorry. - I told you I don't do this. - There's nothing I can do about it. I'm already walking to the bell. - I'm not gonna do that. - Sorry. - We've been over this. - I'm looking forward to it. - Why does he never listen to me? He never, never listens to me. - All eyes on me. I'd like to thank you guys for coming out to the best establishment on this side of the country. Welcome to Love on the Rock. Now, for eight wonderful years, my family has been hosting the most epic broken hearts club for the love lost and the love lorn. Now, I look over there at that clock right there and it tells me two things. - I think it's best to let the hard working folks in this establishment keep their tips, right? - You got nowhere else to go. It's sad but it's true, it's true. Tradition dictates that I give you one more singular hour if you share your most personal, heart wrenching, soul crushing story of heartbreak and love lost. Who's first? - I can start. - Right there. - Here is my story. My first boyfriend broke up with me because he said he was joining the Coast Guard for shipping off to Guam. He picked a public space so I wouldn't make a scene, but of course, I made a scene. Should I tell you? He never joined the military. - Hey, you tell them your story. Tell them your story. - Well, I've been left at the altar. Only once? My heart was broken twice. First time, beautiful English woman, living with her in England. She loves Irish guys. I go away for a month, came back, she'd run off with another Irishman. You want the other one? - Not so fast, Colton, not so fast. Not so fast. Colton. - Colton, Colton, Colton, Colton. - Now for all you newbies out there, this here is Colton Riggs. And Colton's got a story to tell. - No. - Yeah. Yeah, floor is yours, Colton. Floor is yours. - In a restaurant on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, New York City. Been married a little over seven years. But that was soon to be over. Said she couldn't explain why. Maybe I didn't want to hear. Maybe I knew already. She was diagnosed with lymphoma. A rare congenital heart condition. Given a few months to live. As we sat there with tears in our eyes, afraid to talk and had that feeling I wanted to say a million things to someone that I loved, but afraid to break the peace of one of the last few moments spent together. Today would've been our 15 year anniversary, so. Yeah. I'm so lost. Run so far for so long. I don't even know which side is up anymore. Please show me. Show me a sign, God. Show me... Anything. Hey. Can I help you? You all right? Hey! Come on, man. - I see him, we got him. He ran into the alley. - Where did he go? - I lost him. - I thought you had him. - He's gotta be around here. Everybody spread out. - Luigi, Luigi. It is Luigi, right? You're a brave boy. I had a friend like you once, but he was also a little bit bad boy, so you know what I did? I unfriended him. Okay, let me make this clear, hmm? You seriously don't have it? Okay, you can go. Just kidding. Luigi. Now he's going to say it's my fault. He always says it's my fault. Well, I guess it is my fault. I'm sorry that had to be your last meal. Clean up this mess. - Sir, it's that call you've been waiting for. - Thank you. Wingrave, 3791ILS. - Accepted. - Okay, fill me in. - Sir, we've ID'd our big bad guy and he's one of ours. Ex-military brass, family mafia connections. His name is Claudio Fairbanks. He's the main actor behind the lab heist. Retired early, segued into black market weapons and farm in Sicily. - Our paths have crossed once or twice. - He's highly connected, sir. No way we're bringing him down through the courts. - Okay. - Mr. Fairbanks. - Yes. So what happened to the laboratory technician? - The vial was placed on a lab tech named Luigi Santini. - Where is he now? - He's dead, sir. He was a slippery fellow. - Oh! Plaza! - What? - Do we know who pulled the trigger? - A rogue agent. We suspect Plaza Decamilia. - He didn't have it. What was I supposed to do if he didn't have it? Clap, say bravo? - Well, so where is it? - So where's the panacea now? The GN-13? - We don't know, sir. But he did have contacts with the private sector. - Who? - Who's our target? - A fisherman. - A what? - Bunch of regular guys. And one who we've ID'd as Colton Riggs. - Who's that? - A white man in his 40s. A man named Colton Riggs. - He's an expat American. He runs some local excursion business, I think. - He hosts excursions. - So Colton currently has possession of the vial. - Yeah, and he makes terrible sandwiches, I'm telling you. Terrible. - That's all we know from a distance. Our molly's been informed. Waiting on your order to go in. - You know what? You deal with them. I mean, life's too short, man. - All right, contact clientele for sub-service intel. You get me a profile on this man. - Okay, listen to me. I want to know everything there is to know about this guy. - I want to know all of his friends, all of his affiliation. - I want to know where this guy's been over the past five years. I want to know who is mom is. I want to know who his mother's mother is. - This is our top priority. Everything else is sidelined. - Every single rock needs to be turned over. Do you understand? - Lastly, access it all. You pull up the 1010 icon tapes. - Already done, sir. Landing in your encrypted folder... Now. - Hello, Miss Lacroix. I'm glad to see you've been given this opportunity. I trust you've been treated well? Okay, let's get into it. You're now Josie. You leave immediately for a standard molly op. - Who's the molly? - His deceased wife. Get in, get close to this guy Riggs, and find out what he knows. Find out if he's our target or a friendly fire. - He carry a torch for her? - Well, naturally. Now, intel claims he's given up on life. He's an ex-cop, seven years terminated on suspicion of graft and bribery. It's a sad story after sad story kind of a guy. - Was he dirty? - No, no, but apparently everyone else around him was. He went bankrupt trying to clear his name in court. Lost his wife, his job, house, his car, everything. Well, after the bad press and the death threats, he just couldn't take it anymore. He ran off to Malta. - Hi, I'm Joan... Josie. Well hi there, my name is Josie. Hi, my name is Josie. Hi there, my name is Josie. Well hi there, my name is Josie. Hi, my name is Josie. The panacea. - If we don't get it first, there's no telling what the other side will do with it. It could change the world. This might be your first field mission, but you've trained your whole career for this moment. I have complete faith in you. I have one recommendation. Don't get close. Your first mistake is caring for these people. Don't do it. - Hey! Great, thank you. - There you go. - Thank you. - Thank you, have a good day. - Good afternoon, Rev. I come bearing gifts. - Come here! Even after six years, it still brings a smile to my face every time you visit. - Well, fresh fish from your favorite fisherman. - Not only my favorite but one of the best on the island, from what I understand. I remember when you could barely tie a hook to a rod. And look at you now. One of the best. You're a gift to us all, my friend. Sure. Look, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. No need to apologize, come here. It's a joy just to see your face. Even if it is only every six years or so. So how are you? How's everything? How's the boat? How's the business? How are you? - That's a lot of questions, Rev. - It's been a long time. - I'm good. I'm just living the dream. - Living the dream, huh? - Yeah. - Living the dream. - Yeah. - You sure? All right, all right. I'm not gonna harp, I just want you to know that you can't keep all that stuff tied up inside forever. Give me a hand here, will you? I just want to let you know that when you're ready to talk, I'll be here. And so will the church on Sunday. - We've been through this, Rev. Sunday's my big day on the boat. Footsteps of Paul and all. - Yes. See this? Salt. Nature's way of cleansing the toxins. Plus making the food taste a little better. I got a lot on my mind too. Yeah, as a trained professional, I remember. - It's been a long time. - And we weren't shooting clay pigeons back then either. - Yeah, well. We were hunting bad guys until we couldn't tell the difference between us and them. - Yep. Just remember, Colton, you're one of the chosen ones. - Can't argue with a Reverend with a shotgun in his hands. - Ready? - What a good little scout boy. Your mom would be proud of you. - I almost forgot. There's a little something special in that bag for you. - Ah, thank you. See you next week, huh? - Sounds good. - Sunday? - Keep trying, Rev. - Good morning, Reverend. - Good morning. How can I help you? - I am looking for a miracle. I heard this island is known for those. - Well, matter of fact, it is. St. Paul. Shipwrecked here over 2000 years ago and introduced the Christian faith to the island. I would say that's quite a miracle. Would you like to sit down, we can talk about it? - This guy? Didn't he kill a whole bunch of people? - Well yes, actually, he did. But that just shows us how even a broken tool can be of use to God. - I remember there was a snake in the story. There was an awful lot of snakes in that book of yours. - How exactly may I help you? - Apart from the mess... It stinks in here. Reverend. Nice shotgun. Very nice. - Hey. - Hi. - You need any help? Oh, is that knee okay? - Oh yeah, don't worry, just a scrape. - Oh, it doesn't look good. I mean, you look okay but your bike, that's another story. - Yeah, I ran over something on the road and damaged a wheel. - Let me take a look. - Oh no, no, I think I can manage. Thank you. - Not on this tire. Well, I can load it in the back of the Defender. Take you back to the rental place. - No, no, no, no. Thank you though. I'll call them actually, the rental place. - Probably not gonna get any-- - No reception, great. - Exactly. Look, it's no trouble at all. It's two miles up the road. - Thank you, really. But it's just, I don't really know you, to be honest. - Yeah, well I mean, to be honest, I don't really know you either and I don't normally load strangers in the back of my car, so. - Well, that's good. - Colton Riggs, I live here on the island. Nice to meet you. - Josie Quinn. Cincinnati, but you probably guessed it by the accent. - Ah. - I'm kidding, I'm from Paris. - Ah, oui. - Bravo. - Anyway, well now that we know each other, how about that ride? - I don't know. - Come on, I wouldn't feel right leaving you out here all alone with all the... Coyotes. - Okay, fine. Thank you. - Okay. So how do you like the island? - Oh, it's unbelievable. Too beautiful. - Yeah, never gets old. - Yeah, and the people, the culture, the architecture. I'm in awe. I just wish I had someone to share it with and... Oh. Sorry, that sounded so corny. Like a pickup line, I didn't mean it that way. - I didn't take it that way. - Oh good, good. Anyways, it gives me a chance to take some great shots of the historical churches for my kids back home. - Oh, you have kids? - Yep, 32 of them. I'm a kindergarten teacher. - Okay. - Got you. - I don't know, there's all kinds of sites you should see. - So much, I will never have enough time. Well, I can't thank you enough, really. It was fun. - Yeah. Enjoy the rest of your time in Malta. - Oh, I will. Tomorrow I'm sightseeing. - Okay. Josie. Hey, if you're serious about seeing the sights... Maybe I can help. I just run a little... - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Miss Quinn. - Hi. - Hi, madam. I wasn't here when you first checked in. I wanted to know that you're fully satisfied with your room, and if you require anything, please feel free and contact me at the front desk. - Thank you, I'm Josie Quinn. - Pleasure, ma'am. Victor Vella, at your service. I heard your bike is broken. I'll tend to it and send you an update once it's fixed. - Well, Mr. Vella, I must say, you're quite the gentleman. - Thank you. - Well, thank you. - Colton! - Gian Carlo. - How are you? - Good. - So how's business these days? - Business is fine. Why does everybody keep asking me about my business? - You're right, let's not waste our time talking about business. Let's just enjoy this beautiful island we're on. - He's entered carrying a bag of fish. I'll continue to watch. - I brought you some fresh fish. It's lampuki, you're gonna like it. - Great, I'll have the kitchen fry it up. - Nice, and I made more of these flyers. You mind putting them out? - Sure, my pleasure. Let's see. You know, Colton, this is the same flyer that you've had for the last three years. Just one question. Who's this a picture of? - That's me. What does it look like? - Not you. Doesn't look like you. Here you go. - Thanks. - Everyone ready? Let's move in. Okay, I'm in, all clear. - In and out, J-Dog. You got about 45 minutes to get it done. - Copy that. Leave me in peace, let me concentrate. - Halston, keep me updated. - Copy that. I got eyes on him. - Colton, you know what would be great? If you found someone special. I have faith you will. - Thanks. - Okay. - Okay, so do we know a name for this guy? - Believe he's Gian Carlo, the owner. - Did Colton hand him anything other than fish? - No. - No? Why don't you go look in the bag? - Copy that. - So did you hear about the kid that was killed last night? - No, what happened? - They found a young man dead in the harbor. - Really? They know who it was? - Said it was a guy in his 20s. An immigrant from Sicily. Just a working class kid. - Just fish, boss. - I gotta go. - Okay, dessert's coming. - Rain check. - Everything's okay? - It's great. Thank you for dinner. - Sure. - He left the restaurant. I'm on him. - Copy that. Okay Jareth, your highness. So sorry to disturb you but we've got a bone coming in. You got about nine minutes to get it done and get out. - Yeah, I hear you. I need some more time. - Give it up, J-Dog, get it moving. - Hey guys, target took a shortcut. 750 meters in and coming in hot. - Just need a few more seconds more. - One minute, maybe 30 seconds. Get outta there now. - Hello, sailor. Or do you prefer captain? - Hi. - I want to rent your boat. - Now? - Yes, now. And... I need to see a map with all the sights. - Yeah, well it's not really normal business hours. A little late. - Do I look normal to you, Captain Colton? Take a good look at me, what do you think? - He pulled it off. - What do you have in mind? - Well, let's see what you've got. - J-Dog. - There's the Mosta Dome. Pretty amazing story, actually. The bomb went through the cathedral roof while everyone was praying. It never went off. They say that the... You okay? - I'm fine. - All right, well you'd maybe rather go snorkeling. There's lots of ancient sunken treasures off the coast of Gozo. - She's hilarious. - She's insane. - Do you have something at night, after the snorkeling? - Well, you're not gonna be able to see much at night. - I see just fine. How about we do something like a night swim in one of your favorite spots, where the water is nice and warm? - Okay. - Then it's a date. See you tomorrow. - They're getting weirder and weirder. - Mr. Riggs. - Yeah. - You getting ready to sail? - Kinda. Although this isn't really a sailboat. How can I help you? - I'm sorry, Agent Stoll, State Department. This is Agent Adler. - Look, if this is about the break-in-- - No sir, it's about the accident that happened after. - I don't know anything about an accident. - The one involving Luigi Santini. - The guy that came over from Sicily? I heard he was killed. - You just said you didn't know anything about the accident. - Well, from what I hear, unless his head bumped into a bullet, it wasn't much of an accident. - Mr. Santini was in trouble. - What kind of trouble? - So he mentioned it to you. - He didn't. Look, he broke into my boat. He took a sandwich, he ran away. That's pretty much the end of it. - You didn't chase him? - Why would I? He didn't take off with my boat. As you can see, he left it in the water. - Mr. Santini was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge. - He didn't. - We have good reason to believe that he passed you-- - If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't. - We'd just like to recover any materials he may have given you. - Otherwise, we may have to-- - Otherwise you may have to what? - We'd rather not. - Colton? - Hey. - Everything okay? - Yeah. - Mr. Riggs. We'll be in touch. - You know where I am. You're early. - Oh, am I? - Come on. - Malta. Known for its ancient sites and its rich and diverse history that spans from the beginning of time. - I'm sorry, it's really boring, isn't it? - No, no, no. It's actually really cute. And you have a great voice. - Yeah, all right, I'm gonna turn it off. - Yes, and can I have the real deal now? - Sure. Real deal, coming up. - Just think. St. Paul was right here. It's surreal, we're surrounded by history. - Yeah. - You must be so used to the awe of it by now. - Oh no, it's... Look. It's been a really weird couple days. - Does it have anything to do with those two agents I saw at the port? - I don't know. Maybe, just haven't quite figured it out yet. Look, I'm sorry, you're on vacation. You don't want to hear any of this. - No, it's fine. I'm a good listener. - I'm probably just being paranoid. I was a cop awhile back. Comes with the territory. - What was it like? - Being a cop? - Yeah. - Put it this way. I came to Malta to get away from it all. - Well, we have that in common. So when do we start? - Start what? - Getting away from it all. - Once he trusts you, then we go in. We find what we're looking for. So let him forget about life for a moment. Believe the two of you are in love. Don't waste a moment, get in, get out. - And finally, this is St. Paul's Island. They say it's where he was shipwrecked. The sightseeing's that way. Follow me. - What? Where to? - You'll see. - You're crazy, Colton Riggs! - Mr. Riggs, we'd just like to uncover any materials he may have given you. - He didn't give me-- - Otherwise, we may have to-- - Otherwise you may have to what? - Your thoughts, Halston? - He's arrogant and threatening. Stress points indicate worry. - What, you think he's hiding something? - GN-13 was with Santini when he met Riggs. And it wasn't after. - All right, so where's Riggs now? - Took a tourist sightseeing. - I didn't hear you. - Took a tourist sightseeing. - A tourist. And who's this tourist? - It's a woman, that's all we know. We have eyes on him, boss. - How about you get my eyes on him? Is that so difficult? - Send the drone in. - So Apostle Paul was on this island for three months after his boat was shipwrecked. He healed a whole bunch of people, including the governor's father from fever and dysentery. - What have you got? - Got the audio playback. - Which is a little strange, when you think about it. - And visuals. - What do you mean? - Well, a lot of people don't talk about this but Luke was also on this island. - Wait, you mean St. Luke, Luke? - Yeah. - As in, Gospel of Luke? - Yeah. And as we know, Luke was a doctor. So it would've made more sense for him to heal the governor's father but then-- - But then we'd probably not be standing here right now. - Exactly. Will you have dinner with me tonight? - Yes. - He was taking me out tonight. That's rude. I need some time to process this rejection. Who wants to go look at the old statue when you can have some real fun? - I gotta call Halston. - Let me take care of this. - Let Fairbanks know that Wingrave sent a molly. - Who are you really, Miss Josie? 'Cause no one is perfect, little miss sunshine. - Hey, this boat is so cute. Can I take a look down there? - Yeah, sure. - Now remember, these people are often very dangerous even if they don't appear so. You never reveal who you really are unless you're exposed. - I know it's not super clean and everything. I mean, I try to pick up after myself. - How long have you been living here? - Seven, eight years. - Oh, wow. Do you fish? - Yeah. - I bet it's not easy. - Oh no, it's great. You okay? - I'm fine. You got a lot of stuff. - What are you doing in there? - I'll be right up. - Wingrave. - Claudio. Always a pleasure. - Likewise, Wingrave. - What can I help you with? - Well, I know that you're a seasoned traveler and I wanted to run some vacation plans by you. - Oh, by all means. - You know, I'm thinking about doing Malta this summer but Malta seems to be a little crowded right now. - Well, Malta was once a well kept secret. But word of its mystical beauty has begun to spread. You know, I have a niece who's visiting the island for a graduate thesis on biblical history. - Basically I want to know if I should be expecting any unwelcome visitors. - Now, I expect some other students may arrive. Chinese and Russians. They all have exchange programs. And they're very fascinated by the history of Malta, from what I hear. - Listen, it's important that I have the island to myself. Do you understand? - Well, there's enough island for everyone to sight see and enjoy, wouldn't you say, Claudio? - Yeah, well I'll make it worth your while. - My while has considerable worth. - I know that, goes without saying. - Oh good, I'll crunch the numbers on your vacation plans and I'll consult with some other travel agents and we'll see if we can make this work. And Claudio. I'll be checking in on my niece. I'm sure nothing bad will happen. I'm just a very concerned, overprotective uncle. - I don't trust him. He was a stone cold killer back in his day. And now he just has other people do his dirty work for him. - Yeah. - Mr. X, Chicago cop, boat tour guy. You are driving the coolest Defender on this island. - Wyatt? - Yeah, boss? - Are we tracking Riggs? - Oh yeah, it's just about time for the big date. - Stop joking around. - I've got him on drones. The GPS system tracker is closed, we got him. - We have to get rid of that molly but we do it nice, like we discussed. - I'm on it, boss. - Boom. Sweet Miss Josie, you've been hacked. Plaza, he's all yours. - Good evening, sir, how may I be of assistance? - Hello. Could you let Josie Quinn know that Colton Riggs is here to see her? - I'm sorry, Mr. Riggs, is it? - Yes. - Miss Quinn is no longer a guest here. - Oh, okay. - I'm afraid she departed just a little while ago. - Oh. Did she leave a message? - I'm sorry, sir. She did not. - Okay. Well, thank you. - You're welcome. - Too good to be true, Colton. Just too good to be true. - Very sweet. I love a true gentleman who brings flowers to a first date. - Why am I not surprised to see you here? - Well, we did have a date tonight. And I wasn't going to leave you hanging like the other lady. - Seriously? What do you want? - I brought my bathing suit. So where are you taking me tonight? - Stop the games. - You don't want any fun? Fine, then work, work, work. Where is it? - Where is what? - You know what I want. It's actually my boss who wants it, but anyway. Why don't we just stop the talk and... - Okay. It's in the bouquet. I don't usually go this far on a first date. - Pretty please? Now, stop wasting my time. - I don't ever hit women. But for you, I'll make an exception. - This is really boring. So why don't you just tell me what I want and everybody will be happy. - Look, I don't know who you are or what you want. But you don't have to die today. Walk away. - You know, can't you see? I do it for the fun. - Stop! - Hey. I thought you checked out. - And went back to your little desk job. - Is that what you meant by dangerous coyotes? - Not really but kinda. You look nice. - Colton, stop, you don't know what you're dealing with. - Well, why don't you clue me in, miss kindergarten teacher from Ohio or Paris or wherever you're from? - What a cute little romance between you two. She's not on your side, by the way. - Well, at least she didn't try to kill me. - Drop it. Drop it. - Fine. What do I care? Keep it. - Watch out! - Wyatt, what happened? What was that? - Let's go, we gotta go. - Plaza's down, sir. She got hit by a car. That was no accident, what's going on? - It had to be done. She was out of control. - Mr. Fairbanks, I'm sorry, we lost them. The GPS tracker's offline. Must have been damaged in the fight. We're trying to get it back, sir. - Okay, all right. Talk. - I'm not a schoolteacher. - Oh, really. - A few years ago, an international coalition funded a radical research group. It was very undercover, double blind. Even the countries that put up the money didn't know what they were paying for. - Keep talking. - Well, apparently it worked. They created a serum, GN-13. It's... A medicine like no other. - I get it. What does this have to do with me? - As soon as word got out, somebody bombed the lab, killed the scientists, and destroyed all of the records. - They wanted it all for themselves. - Exactly. One lab tech managed to escape the carnage. Carrying what is believed to be the last remaining sample of the serum. - Luigi Santini. And they think he gave it to me. - My mission was to see if you knew where it is and to get it before they do. - Ah, you're certainly not taking photos for a bunch of kids. - It's called a molly op. That was my assignment. - A what? - To look like a woman you once loved and to trick you. But listen, suddenly they told me to come home and I didn't know what to do. I felt something was off but I needed to act fast. I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you and I really, truly was looking forward to getting to know you. - How am I supposed to trust you now? - No, I don't know. - Was anything about you real? What about all the religious stuff on the boat? - I can work for the intelligence community and be a believer too, can't I? - I don't know, you tell me. What's your real name? - You're safer if you don't know. - I don't know how I could be any less safe. Let me just review. All right, I have been tracked, chased, probably bugged. People around me are getting murdered and a crazy killer lady's been set loose on me. All because of some miracle drug that keeps people from getting the flu? - No, you don't understand. It's a cure all. Everything, cancer, diabetes. All of them, gone in an instant. It's a miracle. - I need to get as far away from you as possible. - No, Colton, we need to stay together and we need to find GN-13. I believe you may know where it is. - I don't. - Maybe not consciously, but it's in your head and I can help getting it out. - Like how? Hypnosis? - No. It's kind of, it's complicated. - Look lady, this is not my problem. - Yes, it is. Colton, they won't stop until they get what they want. - We'll see about that. - No more games. You're up. Bring him to me. Alive. - What are you doing? They flagged your cards. Might as well just call them and tell them where we are. - I'm aware of that. It's time to change the game a little bit. Watch this. Let's see how long this takes. Game on. - Got him, ATM, First Republic Bank of Malta. - Oh wow, that was quicker than I thought. Let's go. - Hey, did you dress up for me? - Yeah. - I had a dress picked out for tonight, you know. - Oh yeah, what color? - Green with a little bit of blue-- - You know what, can we talk about this a little later? - So typical. - We're gonna lose them. - They ran into the alley. - Come on, seriously? Hold on, give me one second. I'm doing my thing here. And they're coming out on the other side. Now. - Where? They're gone. - Hold on, I'm looking. - Done, stand by. The GPS tracker is coming back online. Batteries are good. Should be good on your end. - Okay, copy that. Sweet. Tracker's up, back in business. - Gian Carlo, we need to talk. - Do I know you? - Got him, they're at the corner of Daran and Tura Street. They're headed for the docks. Do you see them? You're right on them, you're right there. - No, I don't see them. They're not here. - It says they're right there, look. - Yeah, we lost them. I'm gonna keep searching. - Man, what's up with this tracker? - I don't know, everything's in the green here. - Yeah, well maybe it's still broken. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a little bit confused. I spend a lot of money on equipment and special ops teams. So why exactly can't you bring in a former Chicago cop? Why? - I thought we lost them. How do they keep following us? - They must have something planted on us. Tracker or something. All right, first, we need to take our clothes off. And then we'll deal with that. - You want me to take my clothes off? - Yes, you've got to take your clothes off. Not like that. It's just... Come on. - They're moving west, to the Shopping District. - When do you think they put a tracker in our clothes? - Got me. They've probably been following us for days. Inside, grab something to wear. Yeah, this'll work. Can I look? - Don't look. - Sorry. - They went into a gift shop, they're still inside. The signal has stopped but they're not moving. - Malta. Known for its ancient sites and its rich and diverse history that spans from the beginning of time. - Wait, I hear something. - For example, Valletta. They say really it's a city built by a gentleman or gentlemen. You know of its existence 'cause the night of St. John, who constructed... - We lost them. These guys are smarter than they look. - Got it. - Think those are the two from the van. - I think so. - Corinthia Hotel, how may I be of assistance? - Senor Vella? Yeah, this is Josie Quinn. - Ah, Miss Quinn. So good to hear from you, may I be of help? - Yes, I could really use your help. But I have to warn you, it might be dangerous. Let's go. Oh, this is fun. This is bumpy. - Can this guy not be so bumpy? Finally. Victor. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Medical kit. A very special bottle of wine from my private collection. - Thank you. - So get some good rest, my friends. You're off the grid and I'll make sure of it. - Thank you. - You're bleeding. - You trust that guy? - Well, I trust my gut and I came back for you, so there's that. - So why are they so sure that I have this thing? - I may have a tiny something to do with that, sorry. - I gotta get back to my boat. Gotta make a call. - They'll be waiting for you. - Yeah, well I know that, they know that, so. - I completely messed up. - How's that? - I'm not supposed to have a crush on my assignment. - Oh. Well. It happens. What, are you a spy or something? - Not in the way you're thinking. But I do work for the government in a capacity that officially does not exist. I worked on a desk and I recently got promoted to field work. My superior seems to think higher of me than my real ability. - When'd you get promoted? - You're my first field assignment, if that's what you're asking. - Sorry. - I'm specialized in a new intelligence arena. I can tell when people are being truthful. We gather and decode the human condition. Mainly without interacting with the subject. Colton, just think. What happened between you and Luigi Santini? - Come on, nothing, nothing happened. He came to my boat, he broke in, he took off. That's it. Why'd you come back for me? I mean, you said your superiors told you to leave and you disobeyed orders. - I had a feeling about you. - Gian Carlo. You know who I am. You look a little tense. You know why I'm here. No? You know what I could do to you? You better hope that your friend cooperates and gives me what's mine. - Hey! Get your hands off of me. - Riggs? - Hey, Bro. I need a favor. Think it's time to get the gang back together. - What'd you get yourself into this time? - Oh, they sent in the big guy. - You got your nine millimeter? - You looking for this? - You gotta be kidding me. Please. Just a second. - Hello. Yeah, he's right here. It's for you. - Yeah? - Mr. Riggs. Finally, we meet. I trust that you've had the opportunity to get to know my team. - Who is this? - Never mind who it is. I'm being very serious now. You have something I want. - Yeah, I know where it is. Panacea, right? That's what this is about? - I'm still listening. - Give me seven hours and I'll bring it to you. - Keep talking. - But if I see anybody trailing me, I throw it into the ocean. - Da, da, da, da, don't get into threats. You're not that stupid. - You'd be amazed at how stupid I could be. - Okay, this is over. You have three hours to get in touch with me and bring me what I want. It's non-negotiable. Oh and by the way, I've got your friend Gian Carlo too. So let's not let anything bad happen to him, got it? Call me. Honestly, how long you been working on this? - Can I have my gun back, please? Little help here. That went well. Okay. It's just another day in paradise, Colton. Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. - Hey, you're still alive? - Looks that way. Hey, meet me by the church in 15 minutes. And bring Josephine. Hey. - What happened to you? - You should see the other guy. - Why did he let you go? - Let me go? How do you know I didn't let him go? I told him I know where the panacea is. - What, you do? - No. Hey, got a surprise for you. Look up. - What? How did you? - Called a friend. - Genius. - Malta's our island, not theirs. - That kid you found on your boat. - Luigi? - Yes, forget him for a minute and think. What were you doing before you found him on your boat? - I don't know, walking? - Walking. - I was walking. - Colton, literally no one on the planet can lie to me. - Well, who'd want to be married to you? All right, I was walking home from a bar. - The night of you and your late wife's anniversary. - Yeah. - Well, maybe you were feeling a little down and you had one or two drinks too many. - What's your point? - My point is you clearly weren't firing on all pistons when you came onto Luigi. So maybe you missed or forgot something. What about the next day? What did you do the next day? - I met you. - Right. You were in your Defender. Where were you coming from? - I went to the church. I brought Reverend Yearwood some fish. - How? - What do you mean, how? I put it in an insulated bag and I brought... I was walking home from a bar. - So maybe you missed or forgot something. - I brought Reverend Yearwood some fish. I put it in an insulated bag and I brought... - Yearwood. - Rev. - I was wondering when you would return. Is there something you'd like to tell me? When you said you left me something special, I didn't assume you meant this. - I'm sorry, Rev. I've never seen that before. - The cure all serum. - Yeah, to be clear, I didn't ask for any of this. What am I supposed to do here? - Everyone has their purpose. My friend, I think this one's on you. - Come on. I'm just a guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Last time I tried to do something good, I fought the system and I lost, big time. Everything that mattered to me was taken away. I'm nobody special. I just want to go back to my boat. - Everybody is somebody. You are special, Colton. - So what, I'm supposed to be the guardian of this thing? Until mankind is ready for it? - I don't know. But I do know I only had this thing for 10 minutes and the devil herself showed up looking for it. And believe me, she was scary. But everything has its purpose. - Gian Carlo, where are you? - Hey, Colton. Sorry to bother you but there's someone here that wants to talk to you. - I want my panacea. I am not messing around. - Gian Carlo, are you okay? - No, he's not okay. He's never gonna be okay. - I'm okay. Colton, I'm okay. - No, you're not. Your three hours are up. I want you to meet me at Fort St. Elmo rooftop in one hour or your friend is shark bait. - Hey, call's been made. Friends are already in place. And hey, did you like that shot? - You still got it, my friend. Thank you. - I'll call back soon. - Checkmate. - Meet Pepe at the corner of Old Republican Theater. He'll have supplies for you. Okay, next up. Corner of Mint and Madea. Tech support's in the van on the corner. - Gonna grab something to eat, want anything? - The usual. - Okay, come on. - Hey, two pizzas. - It's open, J-Dog. - Hi. - Your muscle should be out of it for a bit. Two down, two to go. - All set, Colton. - Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. - Still no sign of that big guy. Let's regroup, meet me back at Love on the Rock. - Hey. - Espresso? - Can we get those guns, please? - See, that's just rude. How about, thank you for all that you've done so far, or, hey, new friend, meet old friend. - Hi, I'm Josie. - Hi Josie, I'm Bromley. My friends call me Bro. - Bro, nice to meet you. - Do you see how nice that was? It was civilized. Old friends meet new friends. - Guns, please. - It... Isn't patience a virtue? - Yep. - Oh, thank you for answering. Just the man I wanted to speak to. Where is everybody? Have you heard from them? - I regret to inform you, they all missed their last check-in. - You listen to me. I need you to take care of this for me. Now! Do you understand? I pay you! A lot! How do I need to say it? Please, please take care of this for me. - I'll get it done. - Okay, so here's Daphne, Rita, Sophia, and Isabelle. And of course, you know Josephine. It was actually my sister's shotgun so, you know, don't scratch it. - Okay, this will work. Where's the ammo? - What do you mean? - Where's the ammo? - What are you talking about? You said you wanted guns. You didn't say anything about ammo. - When you have guns, you gotta have the ammo. Otherwise-- - It's BYOB, bring your own bullets. You always bring your own bullets. - Oh man. - Colton. - You gotta be kidding me. That's my gun. - Yep. - Can I have it back? - Sure. Come and get it. - This is why I need a bullet. - Use your fierce look. - Round two. - I took out the drone. Tag in. - You look nice. - Focus, Colton. - Where's my gun? - Halston's phone, leave a message. - You can't answer the phone? Do I have to do everything by myself? I pay these people! It's just inconceivable to me. Inconceivable. - Reverend, it's time. I'll meet you there. - I'm ready, may God be with us. - Let's go. - Yeah, it's the Reverend, he's here. - Okay, here. - All right, I'll take out the guards. - And I'll meet you on the rooftop. - I'm here on behalf of Colton Riggs. - You a messenger from God, Preacher? Why isn't Mr. Riggs here himself? - What have you done to this man? He has nothing to do with anything. - Him? I don't care about him. This man means nothing to me. Nothing. - He asked me to pass on a message to you. He said he apologizes for your security team. They'll be tied up for a bit. - You don't know my security. - He's gonna come and you're gonna regret it. - Didn't I tell you to shut up? - Is this what you want? - Okay, all right. All right. Hang on. Take it easy. Let me tell you who I am. 'Cause you don't know me. I'm a guy who's worked for a lot of bad men, a lot of corrupt causes, but I was a good soldier. I served my country. I did what I was told. - Well, this is convenient. - And now it's my turn. That's my ticket out. Hand it over. - You do not get to judge the moral conduct of mankind. - You don't get to judge me, Preacher. I'm not an evil man. I'm just a guy that was trained to complete his missions. And now, GN-13 is my mission. - What you have done here will never be forgotten. - Okay, okay. All right, that was good. You expect me to believe that that's the real GN-13? Come on, you think I'd be that stupid? Where's Colton Riggs? - Game over, Fairbanks. Gian Carlo. You okay? - I've been better. - What game is that that's over, Riggs? No, you don't win this game. I'm the guy that wins. You are just a loser that came to this beautiful place to waste his life. - Oh. People have been saying that about me for 10 years. And maybe it's true. But today... You lose. - Ooh. Have you looked around? Look at this place. You think I would give it up that easy? This is my world. And GN-13? It's bigger than you. Bigger than all of you. So do me a favor. Put your guns down. Come on. There you go, thank you. Put them down nicely. There you go. That's it. That's it. Now we can talk. - Hey, is this a party without me? Huh? - Plaza, I thought you were dead. - Well, it occurred to me that you were losing your touch. I was taking orders from a legend who was just not good enough anymore. So the organization now needs someone maybe with more style, more bravado, huh? - I don't have to listen to this. - You thought I was just going to let you bark orders at me. That I wouldn't make my own plan? You hit me with a car! - I did not. That was him. - Right. - You've become unpredictable. You're not gonna get away with this. You're gonna be hunted down. - By who? This one? - Well hello, Mr. Fairbanks. Life is full of surprises, isn't it? The reality of things is you just never know who to trust, and well, you had a blind spot. Today you clearly let your guard down. - No one kills Plaza. - Plaza. We're gonna go. We didn't come to kill anyone today. - Then why did you come here? - That's a good question. We'll let you guys sort it out. You guys want to go home? - Hey, she tried to kill you. - Yeah, well, it happens. - Fairbanks, I made a deal with your protege. She will now run your operation and I'll help her fund it. Oh and by the way. My friends in China and Russia wanted to send their regards. Goodbye. - You're just too boring. Too boring. - All right, all right, all right, all right. It's not my day. - Let me and Colton go too. - Listen lady, you can keep the guy. I was not even into him anyway. - Hey, really? - Yeah, really, just go. Wait a minute. Where's the serum? - No one listens to me. I don't have it. - I probably destroyed it when I shot the poor lab guy. - Maybe. - I don't think it's over. There's always another organization, another Fairbanks. - Well, good thing I have you guys. - You do realize, Colton, that you've just been tested. So the burden remains on you. - That's where that was. Now what? - You should be asking where to. - Want to head north? - How far north? - I just remembered I didn't renew my passport. - Well, good thing I did. How does the name Ken Marshall sound? - Who is that? - It's you, my love. - Do I even want to know your real name? - I have a few. But my real name is Marionne Lacroix. - Enchanting. - We have the signal. The former molly agent and lover boy are leaving the port headed north. What do you want to do? - Stay on them 24/7. Such a disappointment, Miss Lacroix. May have fooled Plaza, but you didn't fool me, so you run. You enjoy your vacation while you can because there is no sanctuary, no safe harbor. That serum is mine.
