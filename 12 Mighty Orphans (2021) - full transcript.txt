[MARCHING BAND PLAYING FANFARE] [CROWD CHEERING] [WIND WHISTLING] [♪♪♪] DOC: Vicious winds peeled the topsoil off the plains and prairies of the Texas Panhandle, creating a waking nightmare called the Dust Bowl. It's hard to remember which came first, the Dust Bowl or the Great Depression, but what followed made hell on earth look forgiving and would leave families broken, as thousands of children were orphaned across a nation clamoring for a sense of hope. What they didn't know was that hope was coming. But it wasn't coming in the form of rain. - DOC: Here we go. Okay. - [GROANS] [GRUNTS] - You wanna block? - You're gonna tell me to block? - We're losing because of you! - Hey! Hey! - You can't block or tackle! - Don't touch me! - You haven't done shit! - You need to help. Get your ass out there so I can hand it to you! - You want faster? - DOC: Maybe we ought to think about calling this game right now. BOY 1: Hardy ain't said a word. BOY 2: Think you've done a good job at tackling? A.P.: Don't talk to him like that! - BOY 3: Shut up, A.P.! - BOY 4: Y'all need to do better! Run down the damn field! [♪♪♪] WHEATIE: What now, coach? [PEOPLE APPLAUDING, CHEERING ON RADIO] ROOSEVELT [ON RADIO]: Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Daddy, what are all these people doing? - Rusty. Rusty. - Yes? Well, honey, they're finding a new place to live. I want to go back home. We have a new home now, and we should be very thankful. What do I always say? New adventures brave the heart and set the soul asail. - Isn't that right? - Yes, Daddy. ROOSEVELT: This nation is asking for action, and action now. [CROWD CHEERS] We humbly ask the blessing of God. May he protect each and every one of us. - Is that it? - Yup. Looks like a castle. I've never seen a building like that. Me neither. DOC: A castle perhaps, but this is no fairy tale. The Masonic Home was not full of imaginary beings but of children, forgotten during the harsh reality of these times. WHEATIE: Half a mile out. Fancy? Nah, shitty, old Ford. Ah, hell, you can take them. Looking for a sugar mama myself. There's a lady in there, and, boy, does she look like a peach. Let me see that. SNOGGS: Oh, Lordy, does she got a set on her. Here comes mama. You boys just save yourselves the heartache. One look at me, I'm out of this damn hoosegow. [STUTTERING] Who-who'd want a b-bag of bones l-like you, S-Snoggs? You're one to t-t-talk, DeWitt. Who's gonna adopt a grown man, you stuttering Sasquatch? [♪♪♪] It's what's inside that counts. - [CHUCKLES] - Mommy, I don't like it here. DOC: The orphanage was seen as a cold, uncaring institution where children were to be pitied, if not feared. Are you picking up, or are you dropping off? - Aren't you the cutest thing. - I'm Rusty Russell, the new math, science teacher. This is my wife, Juanita. She's teaching English... - How do you do? - ...and music. - The football coach? Ha-ha-ha! - That's right. Yeah, I'm Frank Wynn. I run the day-to-day and keep the hooligans in line. - Welcome to the home. - Thank you very much. - We're pleased to be here and... - Let's get you settled. Boys, get down here and unload this car! RUSTY: That's not necessary. Thank you, I've got it. See, it's a little precarious there, the way I got it tied up. RED: Afternoon, Frank. Got another stray for your stock. This old Hardy Brown's boy. Found him curled up next to his dead daddy. Smells like it too. - Could use a little scrubbing. - Yeah, we can handle that. Uh, meet the new football coach. This is Rusty Russell. This is Red Wright. - Sheriff. - Football, huh? - That's right. - You're a little south on talent. - Don't even have a field. - The field don't make the team. I'm gonna get my family inside. It's nice to meet you. Can you get the Brown boy up to Doc? - Yeah, I can do that. - FRANK: Unload the car! [♪♪♪] DOC: Orphans were stigmatized as misfits and outcasts and often referred to not as orphans but as inmates. It didn't matter that they had done nothing wrong. Kids without parents were simply second-class citizens. JUANITA: How many orphans do you have? I got about 150 right now. I like to keep it manageable. Everything in order. I run a very tight ship, military style. Leon! Get to the back of the line! You can't trust those types. They'll steal your hat, then help you look for it. [LAUGHING] Help you look for it. Come on! DOC: You got jock itch, Snoggs. I don't want to scare you, but if you don't stop shucking your corn, - your cob's gonna fall off. - Oh, Doc, there's gotta be - something else we can do. - No cure for adolescence, but this might help the itching. - RED: Good afternoon, Doc. - Sheriff. I got Hardy Brown here. Mr. Brown, I'm Doc Hall. You all right? Ah, he's all right. It's not his blood. I assume you can read and write, son. It's okay. You can fill this out later after you get cleaned up. How that'd be? Snoggs, maybe you can show Mr. Brown his new home. SNOGGS: Yes, sir. I'll show you the shower. What in the tarnation are the Masons thinking, hiring a damn football coach? He's not just a damn football coach, he's a damn good one. Took Temple to district three times. He must have a screw loose somewhere, signing on with this outfit. No offense, but this is no Poly High. Well, not yet. To the New Deal. Unh! All right, here we go. One, two. [GRUNTS] I'll get that fixed right away. JUANITA: Careful, careful. - Watch out. - [COUGHS] Let's get you some air in here. That'll make it better. [CHUCKLES] Already been unlocked. Hey! Come on, now. All right, okay. [FRANK GASPING, THEN WHIMPERING] [♪♪♪] SNOGGS: Didn't figure you had any soap, seeing as how you came in with the sheriff. Unless you got some stuffed somewhere, but who the hell'd have soap on them? So I brought you some. Fat-ass gets off on whupping our butts. Especially Snoggs' skinny ass. You can sleep here. Any questions? My mama will come for me. Only mamas that come here are the ones that give up their kids. You're an orphan now, Hardy Brown. It'll be all right. [♪♪♪] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [QUIETLY] Don't worry, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get that patched and painted up, all of that. Oh, I'm not worried about the ceiling. I'm more concerned about the fact that we just adopted 150 kids. This is going to be even more work than you imagined. Juanita, we have a chance to make a real difference here. We were making a difference at Temple. We left everything for a place with nothing. That's exactly why we came here. We can do this together. I'm starting to question that for the first time in my life. This decision was not made together. You informed me. There is a big difference. [SIGHING] PINKNEY: Boy, you're gonna have to earn your keep. Mind your elders. - God help you. - [HORSE WHINNIES] George, look after Rusty. When things get better, I'll be back. I promise. I do. - Mom, please don't leave. - PINKNEY: Let's go! - Mommy! - [STIFLED SOB] [♪♪♪] Not much to look at, is it? Matter of perspective, I guess. I like your optimism. We need more of that around here. I'm E.P. Hall. They call me Doc. Rusty Russell. I'm a new teacher... Oh, I know who you are. And I know what you can do with mediocre talent. I saw what you did - against Corsicana in '34. - Oh, yeah. That's why I recommended you for this job. - You did? - Yes, sir. - Why'd you do that, doctor? - Well, like I said, I like your optimism. - Okay. - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] This field used for anything? Mexican lad used to graze his goats up here a while back. Guess he quit the goat business. - Goat must've liked to eat rocks. - That's right. I grew up out in West Texas. I know goats don't need much grass, but I never knew one that liked to eat rocks. These were Fort Worth goats, coach. Fort Worth goats are different. [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLING] - Heh, all right. - BOYS [CHANTING]: Fight! Fight! Fort Worth goats, huh? - Uh-oh! - Fight, fight, fight! [BOYS CLAMORING] - Kick his ass! - Get him! Hey! Hey. Stop that! Didn't take you long to make friends. Hey, calm down. Take it easy, son. - No, it's over. Hey. - Calm down. Calm down. Look at me. You all right? What is going on? DOC: Nothing to be concerned about, Frank. A little misunderstanding about who's gonna play what position on the new football team, right, lads? - That's right. - Sure. The rest of you should come out too. Well, the way I see it, you can either work the field or play the field. Hell, sounds good to me. I'm in. - See you on the field. - All right, good deal. - Might as well. - Okay. RUSTY: Here we go. Looks like there's gonna be some changes around here. [CHUCKLES] Oh, nothing changes around here, Doc. [FLASK CLINKS] You should know that more than anyone. DOC: Rusty knew that life inside the orphanage held little promise. Chicken, I'm putting a football team together. We could use a good athlete like yourself. Oh, thank you, sir, but I ain't never played football before. I ain't so good with balls, just mainly eggs. RUSTY: Boys, think about joining this team I'm putting together. He knew that football would inevitably bring self-respect to these boys. We teach survival here. If we don't, they'll never make it on the outside. Well, the Masonic board hired us to implement a curriculum and a football program that'll prepare these kids for new opportunities - beyond manual labor. - Right. I'm sure you're probably aware that the Interscholastic League has strict guidelines when it comes to admitting teams. - Yes, sir. - Convince them, then go ahead and have your football program. - Okay. - But it's very important that it does not interfere with the day-to-day at the home. What is it that you produce at the home, if I might ask? FRANK: More paper! And get these rollers cleaned faster. You boys wouldn't last two days in the outside world. Hey! God! - These are two-dollar shoes! - It was just an accident. Do you have something to say for yourself? Do you? Huh? My brother ain't said more than four words since he was little. He's got a mouth, doesn't he? Are you dumb or are you just plain crazy? Listen here. He's clumsy. - He didn't mean to... - Who you talking to? Hug that pole! This should open his mouth. I have a lovely little prescription. Maybe this will open your mouth, huh? - It's a little kiss of mercy! - [GRUNTS] Yeah, that'll make you wide-mouthed, won't it, boy? - Whoo! - CRAZY: Ow! You gonna feel this one, boy! You gonna... Do not hit that boy. - You understand? - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] - I think you're making a mistake. - Yeah? And you, you don't have any authority here. It's my class. My rules apply. Actually, it's 9:20. These boys are due in my classroom at 9 a.m. Do not release them tardy again. See... See, those are my rules. All right? Let's go, gentlemen, right now. Let's go. Come on. My name's Harvey Nual Russell. But you can call me Mr. Russell. I grew up in Fredonia, Texas, and my father farmed and he drank. He's a better drinker than he was a farmer. Life's difficult, hard work leads to great beginnings, knowledge is power, and education... Boys, that's the key. So let's begin with a question. You got four apples and they're setting in a basket, and you gotta feed 16 people. How many baskets do you need? What do you think? Any of you. What about you, young man? Howdy, sir. My name is Leon gosh damn Pickett, and honestly I think the answer's none. Make everybody bring their own damn apples. - [BOYS LAUGHING] - RUSTY: Incorrect. And I don't appreciate the swearing, Mr. Pickett. - Sit down. - Yes, sir. Thank you. Take your hat off. You too. Get your head up off the desk. Get your hand out of your head. How about you, sir? Stand up. - I-I-I'm not sure, s-s-sir. - [CHUCKLES] Four into 16. What do you think? It's all right. Sit down. [SCOFFS] Mr. Brown, what do you say? Four into 16. - Four. - Four. He's correct. Come on up to the board. Show everyone how you figured that out. Come on up, son. Go ahead. Just write it out. [♪♪♪] There you go. It's okay. Just show them how you figured it out. It's all right, son. You're the teacher. Figure it out yourself. - [WHISTLES] - Ooh! [BOYS MURMURING, EXCLAIMING] It's all right. We'll get to it. Now, who of you has played football before? How many of you actually held a football before today? Least we don't have to start from scratch. Doc, where are their shoes at? Well, sir, we have two seasons here, one with shoes and one without shoes. This here is the without shoes season. You need shoes to play football. And helmets and pads and jerseys. But you do have players. - [WHISPERS] Optimism. - Right. Okay, boys, one step at a time. Now, the more mass an object has, the greater its kinetic energy. Now, DeWitt's energy, it's clearly greater than old Snoggs over here because Snoggs is a little smaller. Snoggs' velocity can be reached quicker, and he can maneuver it to divert and transfer that energy in another direction, faster. Get down in defensive stance for me. Notice your opponent's knuckles. If they're white, he's leaning too far forward. You throw him off his feet. Balance is key. All right, let's line up. Eight-on-eight, right down here. DOC: Choose a partner, one-on-one. RUSTY: On one. Ready! Set! Hike! DOC: When you hear the word "hike," that means the ball has been centered and play may commence. Ready! Set! Hike! RUSTY: Come on, boys. You gotta use leverage. Drive with your lower body. You can't wrap up and put your opponent in a headlock. Looks like an Arthur Murray dance class. - It ain't funny. - And it ain't funny! [♪♪♪] - [GRUNTS] - [YELLS] [BOTH GROAN] Whoo! What the hell, Hardy? - [BOYS EXCLAIM] - Whoa! - Should've been quicker. - You all right? You okay? - RUSTY: Hey, check him out. - I'm here. Don't move, Scott. - You just got your bell rung. - Now, here's what's gonna happen. Mr. Brown gonna run to the water tower and back till I say stop or you drop. - You got it? - Yeah. What? - Yes, sir. - That's right. - Now, hit it. - Move. [BOYS LAUGHING, CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] God dog. Sumbitch is still running. Toughest old mule I ever saw. - He ain't so tough. - If he ain't tough, then you're a little flower, because he tossed you around like a rag doll. My old man used to say the best horses are always the hardest to break. Yeah. Every horse wants to be ridden. Some are just particular about when and how. I'll drink to that. - Here you go. - No, no. - Juanita'd have my hide. - [CHUCKLES] Funny the things you miss about a woman. - Even the henpecking, no offense. - You ever been married, Doc? Yes, sir. Agnes. Lost her and the baby in childbirth. Long time ago. These kids are my family now. Kind of strange, because that's what she always wanted. Lots of kids. I'm sorry, Doc. I didn't know that. I know these boys think the world of you. That's for sure. It true you don't take a paycheck up here? I don't know where you heard that story. - Is that true? - Well, sir, I know damn well you're not here for the do-re-mi. BOTH: ♪ You ain't got The do-re-mi, boy ♪ ♪ If you ain't got That do-re-mi... ♪ [HARDY YELLS, GASPS] Think you might be too hard on that boy? I'll go check on him. - That's enough. - [GRUNTS] Hardy. Now, look, I understand that you don't want to be here, and I get that you're angry, but I want you to know something. Look at me. I'm here for you, son. I'm not your son. Look, you can make me play this little game of yours. Don't mean I gotta like you. [PANTING] We done here, coach? Go ahead. Every second that they're on the field, we're losing money. You make it sound like we're running a damn assembly line. - Yeah, well... - Just ease up on any new printing jobs till I figure this football program out. - Oh, Bill. - Hey, new rules, page 24, section C. It's gonna be real tough to field a team if most of these boys aren't able to pass - their standardized test. - Section C? - Mm-hm. - RUSTY: Watch where you're going. - Just keep it moving. - Speak of the devil. - RUSTY: To Mrs. Russell's room. - Mr. Russell? Y'all should be on opposite sides. - Yes, sir? - The Interscholastic League has agreed to hear your request for admittance. Oh, that's great news. I'm happy to hear that. However, new rules state that all players are required to take a basic aptitude test. - All right. - Rules are rules. Shame to come all this way and not even be able to play ball. Page 24, section C. Oh, thank you. You take that with you and let me know if you have any questions. - All right, then. - Thank you for your time. The sensational struggle for existence. The result of this is the formation of a new species, perhaps known as the great orphan football player. I kind of like that. It's science, gentlemen, it's evolution, and it's happening all around us. William, I do appreciate your time. Frank, it's always good to see you. I'm gonna get on to class. Thanks for the notebook. [♪♪♪] The survival of those who are better equipped for surviving. Some are heritable traits. That means they're inherited. Others are learned. That means you learn them. "Those," "these," "there," "that." ALL: "Those," "these," "there," "that." RUSTY: But our focus will be on learning through intense practice through repetition, so that we can pass this test together. DOC: Fumble! Come on, coach, that's horseshit. Horse excrement. I've never seen a more chaotic clamber for a football in my entire life! Most boys your age could pass this test blindfolded, but you're not most boys, are you? - RUSTY: You need to focus. - They had the fundamental idea. - Are you kidding? Come on. - No, sir. You're better than most boys. You're unique. You've dealt with hardship. Now you got something to prove, - and that's called motivation. - [JUANITA CLEARS THROAT] Is this test gonna cover female parts? Because I'm looking to get a little hands-on practice, - you know, sharpen my skills. - [BOYS LAUGHING] No, Snoggs, unfortunately for you, it won't. But the examination will cover reading, writing, science and arithmetic. Arithme-what? - Does that mean we gotta dance? - Coach, I-I don't dance. Everything that's donated to the home goes down here. RUSTY: All right, boys, this is from Dutch Meyer, Texas Christian University athletic department. Shoulder pads, helmets and cleats. Find cleats that fit you. Don't want you getting blisters. I'm gonna teach you how to become ladies. Come on, it'll be fun. Heh-heh! - Yes! Yeah! - [ENGINE RUMBLING] DOC: What I tell you? What's that? - "Tie-on." - [BOYS LAUGH] What do you think, coach? I think it looks good. You got those on backwards, Chicken. - Is a dozen six or 12? - I don't know. - "Block"? - That's right, Leon. - Thank you, sir. - Twenty percent off next time. Good doing business with you. Ha! RUSTY: That's where all life began, and I've always found it particularly fascinating that... Damn it, boys! All right, that's good. [BOY WHISTLES] "Wild Saddle"? "Men's Club"? We're not here to practice our reading! Get to work! Now! MILLER: Mr. Russell, you forgot the final valence electron. You're right. Thank you. You don't pass the test, you don't play football. So let's buck up and let's bear down and let's get back to work. [♪♪♪] Two minutes. [SNAPS] - Time. - BILL: Pencils down. PROCTOR: You'll have your results on Wednesday. Stack them neatly. Thank you. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] It's a good field. Well, I don't know if you can technically call it a field. Well, it doesn't have to be fancy to know what it represents. [SOFTLY] Yeah. Even if those boys don't pass, we have a purpose here that's greater than football. I ever tell you how attractive you are when you're optimistic? No, I don't believe you have. Well... maybe one day I will. - Oh, Rusty. - Hey. [LAUGHS] Hike! DOC: Whoa! Hold on! There's a penalty here! Carlos, you may not trip anyone! [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] That's 15-yard penalty against the defense. - Let's move it back. - They only take the young ones. Be good, all right? Take care of your new mom and dad. I'm sure you boys are all chomping at the bit to hear about your test results. Miraculously, some of you pulled it off. Scott, Hal, Jerry, Daniel, step forward. I'm sorry, boys. Didn't pass. Better luck next time. Which means the remaining of you can play ball. That is, if Mr. Russell gets you all accepted into the district. RUSTY: Natural selection seems to have reduced our team to only 12 players. So let's consider that high-level evolutionary fitness will allow us to play both ways. Leon, you and Chicken gotta be ready to rotate in at various positions. Y'all think you can do that? It sounds like they're a lesser species. I should be the first string. I'm the fittest sumbitch out here. Pickett, you know that was our only football? - Sorry, coach. - All right, now hit the tower. - Let's go. Hustle! - [BOYS GRUMBLING] They wear on me sometimes. I gotta be honest with you. At least one good thing came out of all that. - What's that? - We got ourselves a punter. That's true. Can you stitch that thing up? I'm not a veterinarian, but I'll try. - Let me get it. - All right. [CHUCKLES] JUANITA: Well, girls, I hope this works. - Morning. - JUANITA: Morning. What's this? - It's your new football. - [CHUCKLES] Is that right? We're making two, in case you pop one. Very fitting for these trying times. I like it. Scoot over. What's that? A science experiment? RUSTY: That's right, Snoggs, to see who wants to play and earn a real ball. If you don't want it, ain't no use in us being out here, sweating like a bunch of dirt farmers. Practice over already? I don't know, Doc. It's up to them. Six-on-six. Miller, A.P., Fairbanks, Snoggs, DeWitt, you're with me, and I'm playing tailback. - Why you get to play tailback? - Because I'm tall and handsome. I like your hands-on approach. In my business, we call it scouting. We get the ball first. Losers steal the grape juice. DOC: I'll be damned if Wheatie doesn't look - like a genuine leader. - Set. Hike! Oh! [DOC LAUGHING] - Lineman, maybe? - I think you're getting this scouting thing down. Hike! - RUSTY: All right. - DOC: There's a runner! Talent in each of these boys. It's our job to find it. - Think you're up to the task? - What? I mean I need you to have your wits about you, Doc. Don't you worry about me. You know you're supposed to tackle him, right? Hike! Oh, my. [GASPING] - Oh! - DOC: Are you all right? It's just flour. We can wash it out. Hang on. Just get back to the game, boys. We can't. Hardy busted the ball. Well, don't just stand around scratching your nuts. Go on, hit the tower, all of you, pronto! RUSTY: I'm sorry. Sorry? No, I'm fine, Doc. I'm okay. I'm fine. [CLEARING THROAT] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLING] GEORGE: Rusty, look at me. You're fine. [BOMB WHISTLES, EXPLODES] Hey, it's time. We've got to spread out. RUSTY: George! Guys! Stay with me, George. DOC: I'm just hoping we got a quorum of coaches. RUSTY: Once we get in there, let me handle it, Doc. - How you feeling? - I'm good, thank you. RUSTY: This'll go great. - Rusty Russell. - Luther Scarborough. I heard you took a charity post over at the orphanage. I thought, surely I must be mistaken, but here you are. Luther, good to see you. Been since the '35 playoffs, right? - It was a close game. - Tough loss. For you. - You did a good job down there. - [LAUGHS] Yeah, it got me one of these. Oh, that's nice. Is that, what, topaz? Apparently, you boys are filing a request to join my district. That's correct, and I better get in there. Good to see you. [CHUCKLES] Orphan football. That's as dumb as letting women vote. RUSTY: It's my belief that if we show faith in these boys, they'll prove themselves, much as David did against Goliath. All I ask is that you give these boys a chance - a chance to compete. - The Interscholastic League requires a minimum enrollment of 500 students to compete in Class A football. Your home has only 150 children. Your football team has only 12. - That's right, 12. - Motion is denied. All right, let's get back to why we're here today. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I would like to request a clarification from the committee, if I may. - And you are? - I'm Dr. E.P. Hall. I'm the Masonic Homes physician as well as the team medic. He's the assistant. He's a drunk. RODNEY: You're an assistant medic? Assistant coach. He's the head of the defense. Mr. Hall, do you or do you not have something to address? Yes, sir, indeed I do. If I may, I would like to direct your attention to page 27, paragraph two of the league rule book. It states and I quote: "Any school that does not meet the minimum enrollment of 500 students can be admitted with a majority vote of the coaches in the school's division," Unquote. Now, sir, I am a firm believer in doing things by the book, which in this case, Chairman Kidd, I do believe that you participated in its authorship. - Am I in the right? - That's a... That's a good job, doctor. Indeed, I did. Accordingly, sir, I would like to suggest that all of the coaches here from Division A vote on our admittance and we'll accept the results. - How'd that be, gentlemen? - [SCOFFS] Good to see all of y'all. DOC: Much obliged, Mr. Secretary. Is this a joke? Page 27, paragraph two. Read it and weep, Luther. [ALL MURMURING] Well, hell, let's vote. As requested from our doctor, assistant medic, all those in favor, raise your hand. - [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] - [WHISTLES] [SIGHS] Hey, guys, they're back. They don't look happy. Doc doesn't have his whiskey. Y'all are expecting someone to do something in favor of us? - It ain't gonna happen. - Hey. Why you always gotta be such a downer, Hardy? I'm just trying to tell y'all how it is. No one cares about us. How you doing, boys? Just go on, say it. We didn't get in. Go ahead. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, sir... - I can't do it. - What? - You said you wanted to do it. - I said I might do it. You told me you were the elder statesman. - You're the head coach. - All right, I'm just gonna go ahead and tell it to you straight, boys. Bad news is... each one of you is gonna need to put on about 10 pounds because y'all gonna be playing Class A Texas high-school football. - And I'll see you on the field. - [ALL CHEER] Good job, huh? Come on! - Huh? - [ALL CLAMORING] Let's us show Poly and those city boys - what we're made of! - [ALL CHEER, EXCLAIMING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: The Poly Parrots welcome Masonic Home in their first game ever. RUSTY: They gotta put their best 11 up against our best 11. WHEATIE: Their 11 looks a lot bigger. It's David versus Goliath, all right. This is gonna be entertaining. [VOMITS, COUGHS] DOC: Chicken, you all right? I had to use 12-gauge baling wire on mine. Today, we're going up against a team that's won two state championships in the past five years, so you got everything to gain and nothing to lose, so play that way. And one more thing. We win today, we take home the game ball. So listen to me. Hit that field with heart, focus and conviction, and you will see good results. Let's get it done. [PLAYERS APPLAUDING] Bribery. Now, there's a new motivation. - To the game ball. - Let's do it. POP: Well, Mr. Hawk, I'm proud you got your football team out. - MASON: Yeah. - You only got 12 players. I mean, most of them look like horse jockeys. Y'all got some kind of weight restriction? Might as well call them the Mighty Mites. - Can I have that? - You got it. Yeah. Why not? You're the writer. [CHUCKLES] - Pop. - Hey, Doc. - Give me a quote after the game. - I will, for sure. Mr. Hawk, we're delighted you're making our first game. - Good to see you. - After all the years and all the talk, we got a football team, thanks to you. Thanks to you for bringing this coach in and his wife. - How's he doing? - He's doing remarkable. You've met Juanita. They're great teachers, and he's a great football coach. We finally got a team. Finally got a team, thanks to you. - No, thanks to you. - Okay, heh. Only 12 players on the Orphan team, and not one can push 200 pounds. Folks, this is gonna get ugly pretty fast. Fellas, the visiting team will call it in the air. - Masonic Home... - Orphans. Orphans, what is your call? - Heads. - Heads. It's tails. Poly? - We'll receive. - Poly will receive. Y'all's parents couldn't find the stadium? - [POLY PLAYERS LAUGH] - Must be pretty stupid. - [CHUCKLING] - [HARDY GRUNTS] A skirmish as Hardy Brown wallops... - Come on, Hardy! - ...Poly captain Percy Maywood. I wouldn't wanna be on the wrong side of that kid. - Who was that? - JUANITA: Hardy Brown. My daddy says he's the toughest sumbitch around. - [LAUGHING] - We're not supposed to repeat - what your father says at home. - Can I quote that? - Oh, no, sir, please don't. - We'll use "son of a gun." That is unnecessary roughness. Fifteen-yard penalty will be enforced on the kick. Hardy, you're out! Come on! Fairbanks, Wheatie, get in position. Chicken, you're in. DOC: It'll be all right, son. Leon, knock one down there. Keep them inside the 20. Line up. Come on, boys. - What are you thinking, son? - What are you thinking, son? [WHISTLE BLOWS] [♪♪♪] And the Orphans pound the ball into the air as it twists in an ugly spiral, straight into the hands of Percy Maywood. Jesus. Get him. To the 40, the 30, the 20. And Maywood practically walks in for an easy score. [CROWD CHEERING] What was Coach Russell thinking, leaving the district champion Temple Wildcats? We missed every tackle. That's all right. Keep going. I find it embarrassing. RUSTY: All right, A.P. Good snap, boys. Seems to me they have no place on this field. I hope none of them get hurt. Fumble! Get the... ...a fumble is scooped up by Poly and returned for a walk-in touchdown. My Lord, they're not doing too good, are they? Stay down in the dirt where you belong, loser orphan. - Hey, hey, hey, take it easy. - Hey, Fairbanks, cut that out! Come on, now, Frank, a little scrapping builds character. It's good for the boys. I don't think it does after every play. - My knee feels funny. - Can you walk it off? - No, let's have a look. - Doc, check it out. DeWitt! Come here. Cheer up, son! It's just the first game! I need you to take 42 and drive him back, son. - Yes, sir. - Don't let him drive you back. Get out there, boy. Hardy, you're in. You ready, son? These boys need you. Show them what you're made of. Get out there. Come on, boys, you got it! Glad you could join us, Hardy. Fairbanks, the ball's coming to you, to the left this time. By some miracle, can we please block? Just give me the damn ball. Okay, Hardy, you're getting the ball. - On one and... - ALL: Break! Come on. Good blocks now, boys. You got it. Come on! - Six-two-one! Hike! - And here's the snap. Brown gets the ball, sweeps to the right, mowing over a Poly defender. - Cuts back to the left... - Go! Go! ...and tries to bring life into the Orphan offense. Runs over his old pal Maywood and into the end zone on a magnificent run. - Touchdown, Brown. - We scored! Yes! - [WHISTLE BLOWING] - Hold everything, folks. There's a penalty flag on the play. Clipping, number 40! No touchdown! - DeWitt, you dumb son of a bitch! - Hey, he made a mistake! He's always making mistakes and you're no better! - Hey! - Hey! [BOYS CLAMORING] - Get off him! - Boys! Boys! - Stop. - DOC: Break it up! - Stop that! - Stop it! Get off the field! - Just stop that. - Get off the field! - Get out of here! Go on! - Damn it. - Stop that! - Get off the field! What's the matter with you? Get out of here! [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] What are you doing? Are you copying me? [CHUCKLES] Let me see that. I put this one here. That's a funny formation. What are you two doing? Well, I think I might have found my new offensive coordinator. If I can even put an offense together. It doesn't sound like you're adapting to your environment. I once heard a wise old coach say something about helping his players see what they can become. You see how she tells me what to do? Mm-hm. You think that's funny? - No. - I don't either. [RUSTY CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] ♪ The boogiewoogie shake ♪ ♪ Boogiewoogie shake Boogiewoogie shake ♪ Come on. Are we not gonna talk anymore just because we got our butts whupped? Exactly! RUSTY: All right. I want to see y'all down on the field. Let's go. Hustle. Come on. [♪♪♪] WHEATIE: What are we doing, coach? All right, it's your new offense, Mr. Sealey. Here's the first change. A yard in between each man, all the way down the line. Okay, Fairbanks, you take it three yards back, get on the same line as Hardy. I'm gonna have you line up a quarter yard directly behind A.P. for the snap. Let me show you how. - What position does that make me? - Quarterback. Quarterback takes the snap. He's gonna pivot to his right. Halfback comes forward. Fake that handoff to Hardy. Fairbanks will roll right. I'm gonna pitch it to him, or if he gets too far out, fake the pitch, keep it yourself, take it downfield. Fairbanks becomes your primary blocker. You'll be my coach on the field. Make the decisions. This is how we'll beat the bigger teams. You gotta adapt if you're gonna be competitive. We don't have the size, so we gotta utilize what we do have, speed. Quick huddles, few time-outs. Catch them off guard. Wear their defense down. That's how we'll do it. What do y'all think so far? I think we'll get our asses kicked from here to El Paso. I don't think it matters what offense we run. Won't be good anyways. Mr. Brown, what do you think? We had no business playing Poly to begin with. We got outplayed and outcoached, coach. Mr. Brown's right. And I take full responsibility for what happened on that field today. Everything. But I did learn something. I told DeWitt to drive number 77 to hell and back. And I'm glad I did, because I got to see what he's really made of. And I believe in him. And now he better believe in himself. And I get it. It's tough to believe when all you've known is hurt and loss and abandonment. I know because I felt it my whole life. I'm an orphan. Just like all of y'all. I know what it feels like to not have a mother or a father cheering you on from the stands. I look at you boys, and I can honestly say I'm proud to be an orphan. I'm not ashamed, and I'm not worthless. I'm a mighty warrior. And you'll feel the same way if you can believe in yourselves and believe in each other. You do that, you'll be able to do what they all say is impossible. So say it with me. I am worthy. - ALL [SOFTLY]: I am worthy. - Believe it! - I am valuable. - ALL: I am valuable! - I'm a mighty warrior! - ALL: I'm a mighty warrior! - I'm a mighty orphan! - ALL: I'm a mighty orphan! Believe as I do. Because it's true. It's true. - Leon, break it down. - All right, get in here. Let's get a "Orphans" on three! One, two, three! ALL: Orphans! [ALL LAUGHING] Mr. Hardy, let me have a word with you. I ain't gonna yell your stupid chant. And I'm not gonna make you. But you do need to make a choice. Now, I obligated you to be here. That was my mistake. You're free to leave anytime you want. That run of yours today, son, that was one of the best I've ever seen. And it's all natural instinct. Must've felt pretty good. Why don't you go warm up? So, what do you think about the new offense? Sir, I think you'll piss a lot of people off, but I like it. Now, if you excuse me, I'm freezing my nuts off. All right. [CLEARS THROAT] DOC: Armed with Betty's drawing, Rusty was about to change the game of football forever. Shift! ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: The Orphan offense has lined up in a formation I have never seen before. What the hell is he doing lining up behind the center like that? Appears to be some kind of new formation, coach. I got that. [CROWD MURMURING] Looks like cheating to me. Six-two, split! - Hike! - Sealey takes the snap. Pitches it to the outside to Hardy Brown. - He takes it up the sideline. - [CROWD CHEERING] Brown rumbles down the field like a locomotive. They fooled the entire defense on that play, folks. - I'll be damned. - Brown takes it all the way - for an 80-yard touchdown. - [CROWD CHEERING] That's a good start. [BOYS CLAMORING] Gosh dang, he's fast, coach. He is. He's fast. You're observant. Everybody's got a gift. What's ours? [♪♪♪] PLAYER 1: Shift, shift! MINERAL WELLS COACH: There's a shift. - We're not looking good, coach. - Dang it. - Thataway. Huddle. - Hike! These fellas have come out swinging tonight, - take no prisoners. - Sweep left! Sideline! The Orphans have fooled the Rams again. - Catch him! - Fairbanks runs in the end zone untouched and smiling. - Touchdown. - Oh, my. I'm thinking about shooting all the parents, starting my own orphanage. Maybe that'll motivate these boys. I want you to imagine your opponent is Mr. Wynn. Thanks, Doc. - That's a good analogy, Doc. - We'll see. PLAYER: Set. Hike! Speedy Leonard Roach leveling the halfback. Nice to meet you, fat-ass. [ORPHANS EXCLAIMING] Pardon my French, but The Rams are getting their butts handed to them. My God, Sealey has it. Sealey looks like a running duck as he hits the wide-open pastures. They're running outside. They are running to the outside. ...the five, and touchdown, Orphans. - [CROWD CHEERING] - [FIRES] [ALL CHEERING] - Good job, boys. - That'll be the dagger there. And Coach Russell's underdog Orphans will get to take home the game ball. DOC: Nothing I admire more than a full-service football team. And they played a great game today. They played all right. Still room for improvement. Improvement? Didn't we just whup the tar out of General Mills? - You mean Mineral Wells? - You know that's who I meant. Hey, Doc, we had eight penalties for over 100 yards. We can't compete against real teams playing like this. We gotta get these boys refocused. We just win our first game with your new system, and suddenly, you're a pessimist. - I need another drink. - Oh, now you're mad, huh? - I'm not mad. I'm thirsty. - RUSTY: How's it looking, Leon? Try to turn her over, coach. I saw Claudette Colbert do this in a movie once. - We're gonna be here all day. - [ENGINE SPUTTERS] LEON: Shit. You orphans can change the oil in my car - when you get done there. - [PLAYERS LAUGHING] Get down here and say that to my face. - I'm right here, boy. Come on. - RUSTY: Come on, boys. Let's go. You just wait, I'll tear you up. - BOY 1: You heard him. - BOY 2: You don't want this. LUTHER: You boys need a lift? No, we're good. How you doing? Very well. Coach, you need to get yourself a nice bus - like this for these boys. - Yeah, that's nice. Fella on the radio said y'all got your first victory. - We sure did. - Everyone beats Mineral Wells. [BOYS LAUGHING] See you next season, coach. If you survive this one. I like them tiny cowboy boots. I wanna get some for my daughter. Where you get those? [CHUCKLES] Y'all enjoy that fresh air. Good to see you. Doc, you shouldn't have done that. - I know. It was half full. - That's not what I meant. - Come on, get in. Let's go. - [ALL LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Huh. Kid, you ought to come work for me at the Star-Telegram. You'll sell more papers. LEON: You know what them Dallas girls say after a good poke? - No, what? - "Get off me, Dad. - You're crushing my smokes." - [ALL LAUGHING] ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: The Highland Park Scots are one of the toughest teams and a favorite in the district. You still write fantasy for that rag of yours? Amon Carter. We ain't the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, - but we're surviving. - [LAUGHS] What the hell you doing so far east? You lose a bird dog or a wife? I wanted to see what all the goddang fuss was about. I tell you what. I'll make you a wager. I'll give you your 12 Orphans, plus 30 points. - Thirty points? - Uh-huh. Five dollars. Between the prince and the pauper? - Pun intended. - Five will get you 50. Done. [VOMITS, RETCHING] - RUSTY: You all right? - CHICKEN: Yes, sir. Tell you what. I can't believe what I overheard. Scots say that they're gonna beat us by 50 points. - Fifty! - [SCOFFS] They said we're nothing but some hillbilly orphans, and that I was a washed-up, four-eyed, half blind orphan coach. - Heh, and that hurts my feelings. - Mine too. So, what do y'all say we go out there and we show these silver-spooned Scotties how us country boys play ball? And from the moment we hit that field, from that first whistle, we light them up? - ALL: Yeah! - Get out there and take care of business! Come on, boys! Let's do it. This is what we worked towards. Get out there. Attaway. Reverse psychology. Good one. Fight, fight, fight, you Mighty Mites! Run the left, run the right! Down the middle and through the air! The Mighty Mites will all be there! The Scots will receive as the Orphans get ready to kick. [CROWD CHEERING] Bouncing on the ground and scooped up by the Scottie return man, who turns upfield. - MAN: Fumble! - He's lit up by number 43, - Hardy Brown. - [ORPHANS CHEERING] Sealey lines up a quarter of a yard behind center... All right, boys, come on. - Hike! - Sealey tosses it to Fairbanks. Takes it down to the ten, the five, - and touchdown, Orphans! - [WHISTLE BLOWS] - Touchdown! Ha-ha! - There we go, Doc. You sandbagging me, pauper? - Every chance. - Fifty-three! The Orphans are running circles around the Scotties, who look confused out there. [ORPHANS CHEERING] - Look at Snoggs! - Roach goes on a wild ride, as the Scots halfback drags him for well over five yards to get the Scots close to the first down marker. Beat us by 50, huh? - RUSTY: It's a damn rodeo. - Show some mercy, Snoggs! [LAUGHING] - Time-out. - Highland Park calls a time-out. Beck covers the guy taking the snap. Hank, you take the halfback. Milo, you take the fullback. Hike! Scots cause a turnover and have found a solution in shutting down the Wing-T by tackling everybody in the backfield, - no matter who has the ball. - They figured out how to shut down your Wing T, coach. Looks that way, Doc. Don't worry. My defense will hold them. Well, this is it, folks. Do or die for the Scots, who can punch it in for the win. Not over till it's over. Shift! Hike! - [CROWD EXCLAIMS] - Whoa! Yes! Defense! [CROWD CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] Ladies and gentlemen, the game is over and Highland Park has lost. Thank you, easy money. Best 50 bucks I ever spent. Congratulations, coach. We should've never voted you in. I cannot believe my eyes, folks, and I'm just as stunned as the Highland Park fans today. This might go down as one of the biggest upsets in all of Texas high-school football. [♪♪♪] ALL: Break! WHEATIE: Set! Hike! Wouldn't old Luther Scarborough have him a heyday if he saw you out here coaching these boys on Saturday? Why, he'd get ahold of the UIL, get you kicked out of Class A football - faster than I can talk about it. - I'm not coaching. They're playing on their own, for fun. I'm eating an apple. POP: Lot of talk about that Hardy Brown boy. He hits godawful hard just to be 17. Well, Pop, that's what people do. They talk and they gossip. Or in your case, write what people gossip about. What if I wrote your Orphans going to state this year? I'd say you're gonna lose a lot of readers, especially on the Poly side of town. I'd be careful. Not gonna lose readers. They'll want you to win. Everybody'll be behind a team with nothing, just like them. Team cobbled together with a bunch of resilient orphans, on top of that, an orphan coach. Quite the backstory. War hero. Overcame blindness to become an All-American. Sounds like you already got your story, Pop. Good talking to you. And I like your articles. Keep it up. Y'all remember what to do? Call this the Snoggs Special. - WHEATIE: You got this? - Yeah, I can do it. I got it. - On one and... - ALL: Break! Set. - I'm gonna smoke you, Chicken. - Just you try. Hike! WHEATIE: Damn it, Snoggs! If you can't do this, I'll get Fairbanks to. - I can do it! - LEON: You know what they say? You play with it too much, you'll go blind. - [BOYS LAUGHING] - Hey, Leon. Snoggs Special, again. [CROWD CHEERING] DOC: In the depth of the Depression, people needed something to cling to. And Pop was right. The Orphans were just the classic underdog that the common folk could get behind. This love affair between Texas and its little band of orphans was not hard to fathom. Granted, most folks were in love with football. It was just as indigenous as oil wells and tumbleweeds. These scrappy orphans are undersized, outnumbered, and every damn one of them plays both ways. I mean, they are full of bull piss and vinegar. That's exactly the kind of Cinderella story this country needs, which is why you should've been the one to break it - and not the Fort Worth Press. - [LAUGHS] I had no idea you had enough leisure time to read every paper in the country, Mr. President. I don't. But Eleanor does. [LAUGHS] DOC: By the time anyone can figure out how to stop it, I'm sure you will have already thought of an even better scheme. - That's what you think. - It's what I know. All right, I wanna bring up one thing about the offense. - BILL: Now, hang on. Hang on. - Get away. I want to see C.D. C.D.! C.D.! Who's C.D.? I am. Oh. Oh, C.D. Oh, my boy, I've... Oh! Oh, I've missed you. [SIGHING] Now, let me get a look at you. Oh, you're... You're so tall and thin. You... You look like your daddy. How old are you now? I'm 17. Been here almost ten years now, since the day you dropped me off. Oh... I'm... I'm so sorry. I never should've given you up. It was a mistake. I... After your father left, I just... I didn't know what to do. What are you doing here, Mom? Oh. I want you to come with me and Earl and spend this coming Thanksgiving with us, so we can be a family again. He's very nice, once you get to know him. So come on. Come on, baby, you get your things and let's go. C.D.? That's not my name anymore. It's Wheatie. Oh, okay. Well, Wheatie, come on. Hurry up and grab your things. Wanda, get the damn kid and let's go. Now! Know what? I'm gonna be in the car. Just come to the car. We're gonna go home. No. I am home. Don't you talk back to me! I am your mother! - BILL: Now, hold on. - Get in the car. - Calm down. - Come on, baby. Come to the car. Please come to the car. - Come to the car! - I said... - This is not your home! - Ms. Sealey! You let go of me! - RUSTY: You all right? - [SOBS] - MRS. SEALEY: Well... - [SNIFFLES] If you... If you change your mind... You all right? What are we gonna do without a quarterback now, coach? [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [CRYING] [SNIFFLES, BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTING] Goddamn it! [SCREAMS, THEN SOBBING] You're an orphan now, C.D. Sealey. Come here. [PATTING BACK] Hey, you'll be all right. Mommy! MARY JANE: George, look after Rusty. GEORGE: Rusty, it's time. - [GUNFIRE] - When you run out of here, you're gonna break right. We got to spread out. SERGEANT: Attack! Spread out! RUSTY: George! - [MOUTHING WORDS] - SERGEANT: Spread out! [GRUNTS] [TRAIN HORN BLOWS] DOC: He spread them out on the field and let them run. Totally innovative. - RUSTY: Widen out, Snoggs. - They can't do this. They can't spread out all over the field. As long as they have seven on the line, they can spread out however they want. This ain't football. You don't just spread out. He did it because his players were too small to fight toe-to-toe with the bigger boys from the bigger schools. [CROWD CHEERING] [♪♪♪] The spread offense was simple. The ends break wide to get open and catch the ball. Until that time, passing and catching the football was something as rare as Rusty Russell himself. The spread offense would go on to become one of the greatest innovations of the passing game in modern football. And Pop was right. Everyone from El Paso to Brownsville had taken a fancy to the perennial underdogs in their tattered uniforms. And winning did exactly what Rusty thought it would for the boys. Being an orphan, and one from the Masonic Home, was something you could now say with pride. Naturally, the rough-hewn boys playing football would soon be idealized like the cowboys of old. That's not your money. That's the orphans'. Are you accusing me of stealing? Ha! [LAUGHING] "Why so much grief for me?" ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: Brown just might be the toughest kid I've seen in years. "No man will hurl me down to Death, against my fate." Like a ton of bricks, Brown lays into him. HARDY: "And fate? No one alive has ever escaped it..." ANNOUNCER: The Mighty Orphans win again. "...neither brave man nor coward..." Coach Russell does it again. The Orphans just might win the district. HARDY: "...I tell you... it is born with us the day that we are born." Very nice. [STUDENTS APPLAUDING] PHOTOGRAPHER: All right, boys, give me eight wins! Get it! DOC: And just like that, the Mites were now headed to the regional championship to face their old friends at Poly High. Oh, Doc, did you forget something? [BOTH LAUGHING] Thank you, Juanita. For everything. It's the best Thanksgiving I've had in 20 years. Felt like family again. We are family, Doc. If you ask me, y'all are the best thing to ever happen to this place. Good night. Night. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] - [BOY FARTS] - BOY [WHISPERS]: Sorry. [WHISPERS] Snoggs? [♪♪♪] [CREAKS] [DOOR SHUTS] [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BOYS CHATTERING] I got that for you, ma'am. I didn't know they were showing Oliver Twist tonight. Think you're cute? Leave them, Hardy. They're just bullies. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: Two-time state champion Amarillo is home to halfback Myrle Greathouse. Standing over 6 feet tall and weighing 240 pounds, no wonder scouts are calling him the best high-school player in America. He's not. Hardy Brown is. WHEATIE: He's a monster. Well, hell, they ain't faced us yet. Damn right. - WHEATIE: Hey! - Come on, back up! - Let's go! - Back it up! - I'll see you on Friday! - I'll see you there! [BOYS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [HAWKING, THEN SPITS] [BOYS VOMITING] Son of a bitch! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Every decision in life has consequences, boys. Hit the tower. Hustle! LEON: I didn't even do anything. If I live through this... - I'll kill you. - Oh, do it now. - Okay. - RUSTY: Mr. Remmert. Highland Park coaches pooled together and bought y'all brand-new game jerseys. Although I got half a mind to send them back after that damn stunt they pulled last night. - You hear about it? - Oh, yeah, I heard. Sorry. Hey, thanks for these. Sorry to hear about your leg. - Yeah, well. - [LAUGHING] Oh, man, they burned his leg. - Yeah, I know. I heard about it. - Yeah. So, Doc... you know we're the closest thing to a father these boys have. We gotta set an example. You gotta have some dignity and stop with this. What we do, they'll do. No more. What the hell are you doing that... No, it's all right. I mean it. There you go. You'll be okay. [♪♪♪] You can tell a lot about a man by the kind of shoes he wears. [URINAL FLUSHES] What kind of man am I, Luther? Oh... You're the kind that wants to be in charge, but ain't. That's why you obsess over your shiny shoes. They make you feel important... but you're not. That's where you're wrong, coach. You see, 'cause what I have in this folder could affect your season. If that's not important to you, well, I don't know. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] Don't you want it? Yeah, I guess he does. Uh, I think that your brother-in-law, Rodney Kidd, will find that intriguing as well. - Is this legit, Frank? - I don't think it's gonna keep you from playing them on Friday... but it should be enough to end their season. What do you get out of this? There's a new principal position over at Poly. Maybe I should finally put these shoes to work. [SCATTING AND SHOES TAPPING] Shiny. - [CHUCKLES] - That's real cute, Frank. [♪♪♪] Ah! [GRUNTS] Ow, ow, ow! - Get out! - I'm sorry! [HAND SLAPPING AND SNOGGS CRYING OUT] DOC: Hardy Brown did not invent the face mask. PLAYER: Hike! - [WHISTLE BLOWS] - But he inspired a great need for it. I told you I'll lay you out, boy. ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: Brown isn't just tackling these Poly players, he's knocking them out of the game. There's more than bragging rights at stake here today, as the winner will go on to the state championship. Hike! - Come on, Hardy! Downfield block! - DOC: He's going! Hardy Brown on the touchdown! [CROWD CHEERING] PLAYER: Knocked him out so hard. - Time-out. Time-out. - [WHISTLE BLOWS] I want you to check 43's shoulder pads. He's got steel in his shoulder pads. Coach, you can't be serious. I'm dead serious. Check his damn pads. I need to check 43's shoulder pads, coach. For what? Well, coach thinks he's got steel plates under there. - [LAUGHS] - Are you kidding me? - Afraid I'm not. - Let's do it. Hey, Hardy! Come on in here. - Yeah, coach? - All right. Uh, Poly thinks you got steel plates in your shoulder pads. You gotta take your shirt off. Ain't no damn way those are legal shoulder pads. RUSTY: Take it easy, Luther. There ain't nothing under there. - How old are you, boy? - Seventeen. Uh-huh. We'll see about that. You mind if we play football now? Oh, you call what you're doing playing? I call it cheating. You're on the wrong side of the field, Luther. Get your damn hand off me, you zebra. Get back out there, son. Playing great, playing great. I want you to take that halfback out of the game permanently. - You hear me? - Which one? The one that's been getting the ball. - That one. - I'll be kicked out. Do I look like I give a damn? Go. Flat pass to Hardy on one. No, give it to Fairbanks. Show off for Opal. - He needs a little sugar tonight. - Annie wants you to kiss her. - [ALL CHUCKLE] - Okay, you lovebirds. - To Fairbanks on one and... - ALL: Break! As the clock winds down, the Mighty Mites have dominated every level of the game today, as they look to add injury to insult by running another play on offense. All right, create a wedge and make a hole now. Six-two, six-two! Hike! - [BONE CRACKS] - [SCREAMS] Get your bag, Doc. Why isn't he getting up? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - [FAIRBANKS SCREAMS] - My God. - Folks, this doesn't look good, as Coach Russell and Doc Hall rush to his side. - Doc, over here! - RUSTY: Hold on, son. Hold on. Breathe, breathe. - It's okay. - We got a compound fracture. Carlos, stretcher, on the double! Listen, son, we gotta get you off the field in a hurry. Here we go, gentlemen. Quickly. On three. - One, two, three. - [SCREAMS] - Okay. All right. - [FAIRBANKS GROANING] Chicken, bring my bag, bring my bag. RUSTY: One, two, three. ALL: Mighty Orphans! [GROANS] DOC: As national attention bolstered the boys' morale, it was a bittersweet moment for the Mites. Goliath may have fallen, but not without its cost. They were headed to the state championship with only 11 players. "There's a new s-sheriff in Fort Worth. His name is R-R-Rusty Russell, surrounded by his 12 orphaned..." - "Deputies." - Thank you, heh. "The Mites and their creative new coach have orchestrated..." "Orchestrated"? What's that mean? - Means we whipped their ass. - [ALL LAUGH] "...orchestrated a new and exciting brand of football - not seen before." - DOC: All right, lads, let's break the huddle. Douglass needs his beauty rest. Y'all got work to do. - See you, buddy. - Bye. Take it easy. You know, I should be the one laying there. Oh, hell, Hardy. Then we wouldn't have a shot at beating Amarillo. Besides, Opal thinks I'm a regular old war hero now. Heh, you know I always have. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] All right, you two. [GIRLS GIGGLING] [WHISTLES] Fat-ass is coming. [PADDLE TAPPING] [♪♪♪] You think you can fool me, you little pervert?! Come here! Come on, come on! Get up here! Get up here! Get in this room! Get up against that wall! - SNOGGS: I'm sorry, Mr.... Unh! - [PADDLE THUDDING] - FRANK: What do you got to say? - I'm sorry, Mr. Wynn! - I'm sorry, Mr.... - [PADDLE CONTINUES THUMPING] [SNOGGS GROANING] FRANK: There, that should do you. [CHUCKLES, THEN SIGHS] Oh, I'm tired, but a good kind of tired. [FRANK CHUCKLES] Gentlemen... spying on the girls will not be tolerated! If I so much as hear a snivel from one of you motherless bastards, you will all receive a kiss from Bertha. [PADDLE CLANKING ON BED POSTS] Music to my ears. Is... Is he dead? - Hey, Snoggs. - Hey, Snoggs. - Hey. - [GROANING SOFTLY] Hardy, help. Hey, Wheatie, go get Doc. DeWitt, come here. Pick up Snoggs, carry him back to his bunk. Take care of him. Where you going? Oh! What the...? [GRUNTS] [GROANING] - You're gonna see how it feels! - Wait! [GRUNTING] [CRIES OUT] You sorry sack of shit. [SOBBING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] RUSTY: Come in. Hey, Dot. [DOOR OPENS] - RUSTY: You seen this? - DOC: What? "Orphan team is accused of breaking numerous state UIL regulations, including age violations and excessive practicing. Therefore, the Polytechnic team will advance to the Class A state championship." They can't do this. - Sounds like they just did. - Coach, they're kicking us out? - What happened to you, Snoggs? - Well, Mr. Wynn decided to teach Leonard here a lesson. He's just damn lucky this boy's so tough. He's a son of a bitch. - Go on, son. You'll be fine. - Yes, sir. I want him found, and I want him arrested! Calm down, Frank. I expect you'll finally be firing this man. Now, why would Bill be doing something like that? Where do I begin? How about stealing gate receipts? How about running a child labor camp for profit? How about sending Snoggs to the infirmary? Think it's fair to these children that you fill them with hope of unrealistic dreams? I'm preparing them for the real world. And how many of your Mites are gonna use football while they're working on a factory floor in six months? You beat a boy so badly he couldn't walk. Now, hold on. Snoggs was caught spying on the girls' dorm, - Coach Russell. - Right. Yeah, he's a 16-year-old boy. What do you expect? I expect everyone to follow the damn rules of the home, including Hardy Brown! He retaliated with violence against Frank. [SIGHS] Damn it, now he's missing. The little bastard attacked me. Now, if he sets foot on this property, I will see to it that he's arrested. That he's arrested? Assault... on one of my staff members is ground for immediate expulsion. This is supposed to be a place to nurture the broken and the weak, the ones with nothing left. You throw this boy away, you break the foundation of why we're even here to begin with. When are you gonna stand up for these children and do what's right? Well, judging by this morning's paper, coach, you're the last person who should be pointing fingers. - Is that right? - Yeah. I think you're just smart enough to know what I think of you. Yeah. Bye-bye. They're jeopardizing everything we built up! It's time for this to end. Everything we've worked for... and sacrificed... it's been reduced to nothing. Nothing? I think this is something. What is that? Oh, this? This is just your fan mail. Been over there for two weeks, but you've been too busy to notice anything. Dayton, Fort Worth, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles. Courage, hope, inspiration, dedication. All the things that you and your boys have given to thousands of people who now believe in something. You think all this is nothing? I think it's quite something. [♪♪♪] WHEATIE: You weren't gonna tell us, coach? Them lying sumbitches think we're gonna lie down without a fight? Where's Hardy? We gotta find him. Think I might know where he's at. Yeah. RUSTY: When I woke up in the hospital, after the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, they told me I'd never see again. And all I could think about... was how my brother looked when he died, and seeing the light fade from his eyes. So I'd try and think back on all the good times we had, when we were kids, with Mother. But then I'd think about how she'd react when I finally found her and told her how he died. And I had to fight to keep the good thoughts in... and the bad thoughts out. What's your point, coach? My point, son... is that you can't give up. You gotta believe. Without hope... fear and anger... they'll continue to dominate you through violence. Sure gets cheers at games. At games, sure, but not in life. It won't let you see what's out there in front of you: your talent, your intelligence. Now, don't throw all that away because you're blinded by the past. I saw my daddy... shot and killed before my eyes, standing right there. Blew him in half. Dead before he hit the ground. You can't just forget that because you want to. Terrible things happen in life. You and I know that firsthand. But you gotta learn to accept it. Like your war? Huh? I've seen you cower like a trembling baby. It's got its hooks in you still. It ain't a choice. It's like a sickness. I told Mom that Dad had been shot... and all she did was pack her bags... and say she don't want me no more. Why would any mama say that to her boy? It wasn't my fault. I didn't kill him. I... I was trying... [SOBBING] It wasn't my fault, coach. No, it's not your fault, and maybe running was all that she knew how to do. And you got a family now. These boys... they're your brothers, and they're counting on you. I'm counting on you. WHEATIE: We need you, Hardy. Soon as y'all done hugging, we got some administrative butt to whup before we head to Amarillo. [CHUCKLES SHARPLY] Let's go. POP: They've proven theirselves against all odds, and to get booted like they did, chickenshit. What you think is going on? What's a hell of a coincidence is that Luther Scarborough... His brother-in-law is Rodney Kidd, who is president of the UIL. - Something don't smell right. - That couldn't be more obvious. Make a hell of a headline for one of us. What do you think about being more discreet? When's the last time you been fishing? [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] Been a while. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: In a ruling that shocked football fans, the Mighty Mites were suspended from the championship. I feel confident that we will be cleared of any wrongdoing. The only thing mighty about Coach Russell's Mites is they got 12-month football going on at that orphanage. Plenty of rule-bending going on to disqualify. The Star-Telegram are urging readers to display the number 12 in support of the Orphan players. Letters of support are pouring in. Gentlemen, I thank you for your time. Great... Gotta get back to my team. Get the hell out. I got practice. RODNEY: Harden Henry Brown, born September 4th, 1920, is deemed ineligible to compete at the high school level, thus forfeiting the entire year of wins for the Masonic Home football team, rendering the team suspended from the league and out of the championship. Mr. Kidd, Hardy Brown's not over age, sir. According to his official birth certificate, I beg to differ. [QUIETLY] Coach, that is not mine. May I take a look at that? - Be my guest. - Thank you. [RUSTY CLEARS THROAT] Hardy, would you come up here, son? Is this your birth certificate? That's not mine, sir. Well, son, whose is it, if your name's Harden Henry Brown? That was my older brother. He died a week after he was born. They named him Harden Henry Brown II, after my dad. I'm Harden Henry Brown III, born December 4th, 1921. Mr. Kidd, may I have a word please? What the hell you doing? This young man's telling the truth, and I have the appropriate certificate to prove that. County clerk sent me the wrong one by mistake, and I realized it when I found this... the brother's death certificate. Whoever snuck you this other document, they made the same mistake. I think we've heard just about enough, and especially from you. We should've shut this down a long time ago, but we are now. My decision is final! The Mighty Mites are out of Class A football! - What? - Bullshit! We have proof! Mr. Kidd, my players come from broken families, sir, or no family at all. They haven't had much opportunity. They haven't been as lucky as you. So if you need to suspend somebody, suspend me. Kick me out of coaching. But don't take away the hope of these boys here. It's all they've got. - That's a heartfelt statement. - It really is. However, we have to draw the line somewhere. Now, I don't... Can you not see that I'm in a hearing now? [WHISPERS] It sounds important. I don't care if it's the damn president. Sir, it is the president. - RODNEY: What do you mean? - The president. Okay, I'll be out in a minute. Just a moment, gentlemen. Ahem. Sir, this is... This is Rodney Kidd. ROOSEVELT: Mr. Kidd, you have probably heard me say: "The only thing to fear... is fear itself." Mr. President, yes, sir, I have. The allegations against the Mites seem to benefit, shall we say, other teams. I am certain that you and your brother-in-law over at Polytechnic High favor the Mites ejection. Wouldn't you agree? [♪♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT] After careful consideration... the decision to remove the Masonic... Home from Class A... - has been overturned. - [CROWD MURMURING] The Mighty Mites will be in the championship after all. [CROWD CLAMORING] [♪♪♪] There's no way I could've known. Aah! The Mites are going to state! [ALL CHEERING] JUANITA: I'm so proud of you. - Well, we haven't won yet. - You have in my book. - Where is he, Bill? - He's inside. [♪♪♪] Hardy Brown. Uh, yes, sir? Well, goddang, son! Good luck in Amarillo. - We're counting on you boys. - Thank you. These boys are going to state, counselor. - Yes, sir. - They gonna kick Sandie butt. [SIGHS] Franklin Harry Wynn, you're under arrest... - Red? - ...for the violation of child labor laws 232 and 241, embezzlement and abuse of a minor. Red, I've known you for 30 years. What are you doing? There's no evidence of me doing anything wrong. - That's it. - Red, now, come on. Give me a break. I mean... [♪♪♪] You filthy weasel! I told you there was gonna be some changes around here, Frank. You know, that's music to m-m-my ears. BILL: Have a good game, Doc. - Thank you. - See you when we get back. [CROWD CHEERING] DOC: As the black cloud of the Depression loomed over the nation, it certainly didn't stop the true believers from following the Mites all the way to Amarillo. [♪♪♪] The Mites were a symbol of inspiration for everyone. They were devotion. They were hope. They were the belief that winning lives within the heart. Halftime at Amarillo. That's right, halftime, because the first half wasn't pretty. But somehow my defense was able to hold the Sandies to just one touchdown. I swear to God, I'm gonna knock his teeth in. - SNOGGS: Hurts like hell, Doc. - DOC: All right. Sit down there. Close your eyes. Here we go. Okay. - Hey, you want to block? - You'll tell me a block? - We're losing because of you! - Hey! Hey! Hey! I don't know why you can't block more! - Don't touch me! - You haven't done shit! Neither have you, Wheatie! I can't attack unless y'all protect! Get your ass out there so I can hand it to you! Coach, Miller's leg. - RUSTY: Put that on. - Maybe we ought to think about calling this game right now. There's no dishonor in making sure that these lads don't get hurt anymore. Think about Fairbanks. Don't matter how hard we try, we don't stand a chance. - They ain't playing fair. - Hardy, you haven't said a word. CARLOS: They're killing us. They're too damn big. PLAYER: Hike! [BONE CRACKS] You ain't so mighty. Hmph. [GROANING] - WHEATIE: What now, coach? - [KNUCKLE CRACKS] A.P.: He's crying like a baby. WHEATIE: Leave Chicken alone! Such a baby! CHICKEN: Scrap of coal would've done better than you! A.P.: Getting our butt handed to us. - Shut up, A.P.! - Shut up and hike the ball. I'm a mighty warrior! [ALL QUIET] [HARDY BREATHING HEAVILY] I am a mighty warrior. I never said it. I didn't believe it. Didn't believe in y'all. In this team. [♪♪♪] I never believed in myself. But now I do. Now I know what that means... because of all of you, because of everything each one of you has taught me. I look around this room and I don't see a bunch of... a bunch of throwaway orphans like everyone else does. I see fighters. I see guys that never give up! And it makes me so damn proud to be an Orphan. Y'all think you're in pain now? Think about Fairbanks. He'll never play ball again. That's real pain. Ours is temporary. "No man will hurl me down to Death, against my fate. And fate? No one alive has ever escaped it, neither brave man, nor coward... I tell you... it is born with us the day that we are born!" We got another half to kick those Sandie asses! Now get in here! Everyone, come on! Mites on three. - One, two, three! - ALL: Mites! [♪♪♪] [CROWD CHEERING] ALL: Mighty Mites! - What do you think? - I think we need a miracle. The Mites start the second half, trailing the Amarillo Sandies, 7 to nothing. And they've also changed uniforms, folks. I've been told these jerseys were sewn together and the numbers were painted on by the young ladies at the orphanage. Turn that damn thing off! Pipe down in there, Frank! Six-two, split! Hike! Snoggs has gotta shuffle that guy off. Hike! [CROWD GROANS] Hike! [CROWD GROANS] - Come on, boys! - For the first time, the Mites' innovative passing offense is having minimal effect against the Sandies. Coach Russell will need to go into his bag of tricks - to pull this off. - Hike! - Come on! Come on! - Go! Go, go, go. - Touchdown for the Mites. - [CROWD CHEERING] What is going on? - Yeah! - And there you have it, the Mites are finally on the scoreboard as number 23, Douglass Lord Fairbanks, takes it in for the touchdown. [BOTH CHUCKLING] I thought Fairbanks was injured. That's Hardy Brown in Fairbanks' uniform. How about we double that bet? Fifty more on the Mites. - You're on. - Damn right, I am. [CROWD GROANS AND WHISTLE BLOWS] Extra point no good. Mites 6, Sandies 7. WOMAN: Good try, boys! Yeah. We're proud of you anyways, guys. - POPS: Pound for pound? - Yeah. - I'll take Brown over Greathouse. - Well, I'll take him too. But you know how he's gotta do it? He's gotta hit him as low as he can, that guy. He's gotta bite off each of his kneecaps first time he hits him, because that guy's three times taller than Hardy. Hike! Another bone-jarring collision between Brown and Greathouse. I'm not sure how those young men can get up after that. Get up, boys. Come on. Son of a bitch is harder to take down than a steer. As the fourth quarter winds down, the Mites are against the ropes. Perhaps there's a miraculous ending for the Mites. ALL: Break! Set. Hike! - [CROWD CHEERS] - Fumble! [WHISTLES BLOWING] Moseley recovers on the Mites 20 with 50 seconds left. [CROWD CHEERING] All right, all right, all right. Come here, Chicken. We still got one more time-out. Short pass to Hardy out of the backfield. You got it? - Yes, sir. - All right. Take it in, son. That's what they'll be expecting. I'm counting on it, Doc. You're better than that. Cover Hardy Brown out of the backfield. You hear me? - Yes, sir. - Go! ALL: Break! WHEATIE: Six-two, wide! Hike! [CROWD GROANS] - Time please. Time. - [WHISTLE BLOWS] [CROWD CHEERS] Get in there. Snoggs, you and Chicken split right. We're gonna run the same play again, only this time, you fake it to Hardy, you tuck the ball, you take it yourself. You got it? - Yes, sir. Yeah. - RUSTY: Let's do it. - They'll never expect you to run. - Leon, break it down. Come on. One, two, three! ALL: Mighty Mites! What do you think? - Huh? - This is it. Cover Hardy Brown out of the backfield! [♪♪♪] Six-two-one! Hike! Sealey's gonna run it in himself. He's got open field in front of him. - See this?! Come on! - Yes! Greathouse drives Sealey out to the Sandies 49-yard line with seven ticks left on the clock. - Come here, son, come here. - The Mites need a miracle to pull this one off. What's coach want to run? He said it was up to us. Snoggs Special. [ALL CHUCKLING, CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You heard Crazy. Snoggs Special on one. Let's drive these Sandies back to Fort Worth. - Yeah! - Yeah! WHEATIE: You can do this, Snoggs. Mighty Mites on three. One, two, three! ALL: Mighty Mites! It's do-or-die for the Mites, as they're down to their final play. [♪♪♪] [SPITS] Come on, boys! Six-two, wide! Hike! Snoggs! RUSTY: Come on, Hardy! - Go! - Come on. [CROWD CHEERING] Get him! - Come on! Come on! - Go! Go! [♪♪♪] [TICKING] Go, Hardy! Come on! Push him! [WHISTLE BLOWS] - They get that, Doc? - They don't know yet. They... - Can't see, Doc. - No, they're not unpiled yet. Hardy Brown is down, and he's taken six Golden Sandies with him. - Referees are clearing the pile. - Quiet down, everybody. Quiet! - Is he short? - I think he's in. Did he get it? Come on. Hardy Brown has been stopped inches from the goal. The Golden Sandies have won! [SIGHS] That's the ball game! Yes! [CROWD CHEERING] [♪♪♪] - Inch. - [SIGHS] Sorry, coach. - Good job. - You too. Good job. [SIGHS] Toughest hoss I ever played. Thank you, Myrle. Pretty damn tough yourself. Come on, boys. Great game, coach. Congratulations. Thank you. One hell of a ball game. - Yes, sir. - Congratulations. DOC: A team that started with nothing left with more than they could have ever dreamed of. What the Mites won couldn't be printed in the papers. It was a belief in themselves that would go on to last their entire lives. CROWD [CHANTING]: Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! Mighty Mites! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] My feet, they... They just stopped. I came up short. You didn't come up short, son. You came further than I ever dreamed. You did great. I look around this bus and I think: "How lucky are we?" Pretty lucky, coach. [ORPHANS CHEERING, APPLAUDING] - Buddy. - Looking good, brother. - Do they know we lost? - [LAUGHS] [ALL SINGING INDISTINCTLY] What Rusty brought to the Masonic Home wasn't just football or academics. It was the feeling of finally being a family. RUSTY: Opal, are you gonna stand up there with Fairbanks? - Okay, we'll let that slide. - Doc, come in this photo. Hey! - Doc, we need you for the photo. - JUANITA: Bring Betty. - I'll be there. Last play. - RUSTY: Okay. For Rusty, it was about believing. Believing in something that against all odds and evidence might not seem possible, but somehow would come to pass. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
