We all know incredible stories. The one I'm about to tell you is definitely the craziest of them all. Fuck! Watch out! - Faster! - I can't go any faster! We're gonna die! Turn right, there! - He's coming back! - We're not gonna make it! He's gonna shoot! He's gonna shoot! Motherfucker! It all started three days ago, with a phone call. REDA'S GYM - Yeah, Réda? - Come quick. No way, I'm working on a car. Réda is the local big wig. I've seen him every day for the last 20 years. He's my bro. He's there for me and I'm there for him. When my parents died, his family adopted me. I'm like their third son. Wait a little bit! - Wait for the others! - Mom always serves him first! Réda always wanted to become a boxing champion, but he never had the guts to fight. So he trains the kids in a gym that has his picture on the wall. Stop! Clap again. Stop! And he's also my coach. Do you trust me? I know this guy. Get up and finish him. I know you can take him! And he always gets me in trouble. The bell didn't ring yet. Let's start over. I'm talking to you! Let's... This is his little brother. Brahim. He wanted to become an influencer by impersonating his idol, Pablo Escobar. Which is what got us in this mess. Hello, guys and girls. I'm Pablito. Our main story is the kidnapping of an influencer in Colombia... ...by men from the Medellín cartel... On the internet, he calls himself Pablito... ...known for impersonating Pablo Escobar. The Narcos used his social media... ...to release this particularly disturbing video. We can't say if he is still alive... The drug traffickers... ...haven't demanded any ransom yet. We'll play the footage now. This son of a bitch here is making money talking about Pablo Escobar. - Help me! - He's my boss! Look how he's insulting him with that mustache. Look at his hair, that's unacceptable. We won't tolerate that. We are the cartel of Medellín, money or a slug, motherfucker. Talk then, son. - Talk, boy! - Please, help me! Help me! But the Narcos didn't know Brahim had an older brother, or that they really pissed him off. Hey you, are you sparring or smoking hookahs? Allahu Akbar, you're knocked... I'm not in the mood, okay? Everybody in the ring! - Do we look like fools? - No! - Are we fools? - No! - Let's show them we French mean business. - Yeah! - What's going on? - You don't know? - No. - Some Narcos kidnapped his brother. - What? - Yeah! Listen! We're gonna show them that this is not a TV show! - Yeah! - Are you ready for war? - Yeah! - We meet at the airport tomorrow. - Will you guys be there? - Yeah! - Let's go get my brother! - Yeah! Tomorrow morning, at the airport! Réda's plan was as simple as it was insane. Take a team to raid Colombia and fight the cartel to bring his brother back. PARIS AIRPORT Your attention, please. Final call for passengers heading to Medellín. Immediate boarding, gate four. Those bastards stood us up! - You can't blame them... - What? What did you say? - I... - They stood me up. All of them! Not all of them, gentlemen. I'm here now. This is Chafik. Trust me, everything's gonna be all right. You may have missed him, but he's also in the boxing club. This guy is seriously confident. - What's up? - Hey! How can you be a dwarf and be so cocky? I said, hit it harder! Hit it! But we like him. We've known him since he was little. - Okay, let's not go. - Let's go. - What? - We can't go. - No! Let's go! - Just the two of us against the cartel? - No, I'm here too. - Yes, the two of us. These guys are from the streets, but so am I. They can't mess with me! - What are you talking about? - Stop bickering! Follow me, let's go. - How can you do this to me? - What? - Let's go. - We've know each other for 30 years. Are you gonna let me go save Brahim alone? I think there's another way of getting him out of there. What other way? By sending a letter to the president? Fuck! I'm going! If I don't go help him, no one will! - Gentlemen! - He's all alone! My little brother's life is at stake. I'll talk to them. Are you gonna stay calm? Gentlemen, I'm waiting! - That's not a clear answer. - Yes! Of course, he wasn't going to stay calm. But I wasn't going to let him go alone. Thank you. Thank you, sir. - What's up, bro? Where are you from? - Hello. From France. - Oh, good evening! - Good evening! Well... - Here you go, three rooms. - Thank you. Between you and me, the Escobar suite is the best one. - Perfect for the big party you're... - Thank you, but we're not here to party. - You speak Spanish too? - Yes. Look, this is my brother. He was in this hotel last week. - He's weird, right? - Totally. Do you recognize him? - Yes, I do. - Do you know anything? - Where did he go? - Yes... The bar that's their front... is the Barraputa. Barraputa? What's, "Barraputa"? - It's a strip club. - Yeah? But it's not for tourists. He's suggesting tourist bullshit. Is it dangerous? Walking tours, restaurants... Are there dangerous men? Yes? I have a lead. The Barraputa. Let's get changed and meet back here. I'm exhausted and jet lagged. I'm staying in. - What could Barraputa possibly be? - A bar with whores. We didn't come here to sleep, we're looking for his brother. I'm with you. I don't see a lot of chicks. - Are we really going in there? - What? Are you scared? - No... - You're with me. - Sure, but... - I have a good feeling about tonight. - Not with that hat, I hope. - Don't talk to me about fashion. - Okay, let's go. - Come on. - What's your problem? - Don't start. How many are you? Three? If she keeps looking, I'll fall in love. Are you French? - You speak French? - A little. - That's great! - Great! That's great, yeah. Can we talk? We have a few questions. - I'm working. - Of course, she wants... She's working so... - Thank you. - Come here. - Come down here! - Easy, bro. Please, do you know him? - Have you seen him? He's my brother. - No. - That's okay. - I'm gonna get another drink. Miss? This is a narcos bar, right? I want to talk to the men from the Medellín cartel... No. No one talks about them here. I can do whatever I want! You're doing it wrong. Let me handle it. Excuse me, what's your name? Cynthia. Cynthia, we came here because some guys kidnapped his brother. If you can help us, if you know anything, this is my number and... maybe we could get a drink later. I don't date clients. You can't stay here. There are less dangerous bars for you. She's great. - She said we should leave. - Why? - Because it's dangerous. - Let's go then. No. We can get answers here. - Come on. - No! This is a bad idea. That's great. A beer, please. - These chicks dig me. - Great. - They want to fuck me. - It's dangerous here. They offered me some coke. - And what did you say? - I said no. - Of course. - Right, that's good. What would you have said? - Me? - Yeah. - No way, are you crazy? - Same. I don't touch that crap. But here, it's purer than in France. - They make it here, so it's all natural. - It's not cut with anything. - It must be a nice experience. - Right. What do you mean, "Nice"? Do you want to try it? Are you insane? I stay away from that. - It probably costs a fortune. - You're wrong. It's two euros per gram. - That's cheap. - Even if it were free... - I meant it's a great deal for its users. - So cool. - But for us? - Fuck it. - We're not here to get high on coke. - Good quality, cheap... Give me some cash, let's do it. Long live the party! Dwarf! THE BOSS In France, if you know me, I have a lot, a lot of money. I'm a big drug dealer. But I need to find some narcos here. Do you know any? Money is not a problem, I can pay. Tell me where I can find one. By pretending to be a big buyer, Réda had just gotten the answers he needed. I thought we had just spent the craziest night of our lives... But what we were about to do was even crazier. Radio station, "El Bardo," with you all day long. Go away. Get lost. No! The party! No! It hurts. Wow. I don't feel so good. How are you feeling? What's going on? No, I'm not okay. I don't know why, but I want to cry. I want to cry too. I feel like shit. - Réda! - I can't stand up! - Réda, wake up! - My head hurts. Our heads hurt too. Guys, I think we're coming down hard. They say people get really sad the day after using coke. I have four missed calls from my mother! No! - And I didn't even fuck anyone! - What's happening to us? And I wanted to take a dump. Me too! I spent the night on the toilet! Okay, stop. Guys, - we'll never use that crap ever again. - No. Never. It gave me crazy nightmares, my dreams were nuts! In my dream, we left this place and stole a car outside. There's people over there. - Hurry! - Come on! Then, you wanted to go to Barraputa and we waited for a narco. - Wait for me, son. - Him. He went out and we followed him. No, he will. Then... We drove slowly behind him and when we caught up with him... - You going? - No, you go. - No. - Yes, I'm your backup. We fought because we didn't want to go, then he jumped on him! Like a flying squirrel! He got him and they both fell! He started kicking his butt. Wow! What? No! What's this? No, fuck... We really lost our shit. We need to let him go. - This is over. - No. On the contrary. This is only the beginning. And... action! Okay, let's talk. Let's talk for real. You've got one of us. You have my brother. Well, we have one of you too. We have a narco. You think you're hot? We're hot too! We are dangerous! So now, let's do an exchange. An exchange for this guy! We're not messing around! I'm not kidding around! I'm serious! Okay? So, get in touch with us real quick through this guy's account, on his phone, okay? We won't hurt you. Ciao. No! Brahim or bullets. We watched the show too. And cut! - How was I? - Very convincing. - On the first take. - And you're showing your face? - What are they gonna do to me? - Right. We'll share it on his account and then they'll know. - Let's think about this for a minute. - Too late. - It's posted. - There you go. Now, let's do this. - Show me. - Look. Okay, let's talk. Let's talk for real. Hey, I'm really handsome! You have my brother. It's Brahim's number. I told you they'd call. - This is how you have to deal with them. - Okay. They know they have to respect me. You finally get it! Réda? It's Brahim. Brahim? - Are you okay? Where are you? - Réda, I just saw the video. - Why did you do that? - We did it because... it's our strategy. I'm gonna tell you something, but don't get upset. What? I did all of this to go viral and get more followers. No one kidnapped me. Followers? You mean... No one kidnapped you? What are you talking about? What is viral? What the... If you haven't been kidnapped, where are you, asshole? In Colombia, just not where you are. Where are you? When I let this guy go, I'm gonna come after you! They might get to you first. - Who? - What are you saying? The guy you kidnapped, is Don Nacho, he's El Diablo's son. The most dangerous narco in all Colombia. He's the son... We're so screwed. That's why he's laughing. Réda? Are you mad? Réda! Brothers! This is what happens when someone lies to me. When someone doesn't follow my orders. When someone disrespects me. But I'm in a good mood. Which one of you wants to apologize so I don't shoot him? You're right, boss. We messed up, but I promise it won't happen again. Forgive us. Apology accepted, brothers. You are like sons to me. Boss, this is important. Okay, let's talk. Let's talk for real. You've got one of us. You have my brother. Well, we have one of you too. We have a narco. You think you're hot? We're hot too! We are dangerous! Mr. Nacho, I got you some coffee. I don't know if you prefer that or tea. I also ordered some pastries. Apparently, they're pretty good. "Coffee." Son of a bitch! Hey! He's insulting you. - Shut him up! - They're gonna kill you, motherfucker! - I'm gonna... - Okay, I got it. Shut up already! Shut your mouth! DAD Guys, "Dad." It's his father. - Maybe I should answer it. - What? You think I'm scared? No, but you could lose your temper. Listen, they're not the local kids you can yell at. - I don't yell at kids. - Okay. Fine, whatever. I'll handle this. - We'll do it together. - I'm not upset. - Okay, fine. - Good. There, smile. Go ahead. Stay calm. Hello, sir. How are you doing? Great. Listen to me very carefully. Yes, we're listening. I don't know who you are, but I'm gonna find you and you'll pay. That's the problem we're having! Sure, but we can sort this out. Let's have a chat, this isn't a problem! - It's no big deal. - No big deal. Listen to me, you tiny piece of French shit. - Don't call me, "Shit." - He has a right to be angry. Sure, he does. But still, he can't call me that. I'm gonna find you and you're gonna pay. You're gonna die. What? - No! Don't! - I'm gonna die? - Who do you think you are? - No! Stop! - You can't talk to me like that! - Stay calm! You said you'd be calm. Calm down! He has a right to be angry! Son of a bitch, you can't talk to me like this! Hey, asshole! I don't speak French! I have a lot of friends in Colombia! I know everybody in Colombia, asshole! And I have your son! That useless son of yours! Fuck! - "That useless son of yours." - Yeah. - You were supposed to stay calm. - I did, but he was very rude. Of course he was! You kidnapped his son! Even if I did, he shouldn't be rude to me! Okay, gentlemen, let's keep a clear head. - There, we need a clear head. Yes. - So you have all the answers? Then what do we do now? - We get Brahim and we go home. - That easy? No problem. - Did you forget something? - What? What do we do with him? If you ask me, - we should let him go once we get Brahim. - Yeah? So we drive around with a gagged narco? - He's gonna say that we kidnapped him. - Exactly. Then what do we do? - Sorry, excuse me. - What? No! That's great. Really great. - I have a plan. - You have a plan? We can't stay here. - Where is the car? - Down there. Hurry! He drank too much! He's drunk! Hurry up before they spot us! Open the trunk. Get in there. - The legs don't fit. - Push them in! We can't cut them off! Come on! - Did Brahim send you the address? - It's three hours away. Let's go. - Don't talk to me like that. - What? You're a crappy operations leader. - I'm letting you drive, aren't I? - What? - Yeah! - You don't know how to drive! - You don't have a license! - Shut up! - Just start the car and shut up! - No. - Come on! - No. - You're really busting my... - Guys, please. We're all nervous, but it's all going to be fine. - Can you start the car, please? - That's better. I like that. Watch out! Okay, hold on. - What are you... - I don't have a choice. What are you doing? Fuck! Faster! Watch out! The bike! There, go left! Go left! - Red light! - I know! No! They're catching up! - Watch out! They're here! - I know! - Faster! - I can't go any faster! Push him out! We're gonna die! Hey! We're not gonna make it. He's gonna shoot! - Motherfucker! - He's here! Wow! That was so cool! Come on! They're gonna catch up on the highway. It's fine, we're gonna make it. I know what I'm doing. What? I hope it's not what I'm thinking. - I saw this on the internet, it fits! - We all did, moron! That was a fake! - A fake? - Yeah! - We can do it. - It was fake! - We'll make it. - Let's check the video. - Come on! - No! - We won't make it! - We will! - We won't! - We will! It's a fake. We made it! It worked! - I told you. - Fuck. - Look. That's it! - Yeah! - We did it! - What do we do now? We do this! No! A Colombian number, it must be the stripper. - Hang up. - Why? Don't you get it? She's with the narcos. No way. It's Brahim. - Réda? - We're on our way, we'll be there soon. Too late, they're outside the hotel. We got him! Let's go, guys! - Hold on! - I told you, they're outside the hotel! Get out of your room, they know which one it is! We're on our way! - I'll take the stairs! - Go that way, we'll go this way. Block the exits! - Fuck, they're coming up! - Get out of there! Take the stairs! Come on, hurry up! - There he is! - They're using the stairs. - They saw me, I'm screwed! - Let's go! Hurry up! - No... - We'll be fine! No! - We got him! Over here! - Let's go! After that son of a bitch! Fuck! Brahim! Open the door! - Try all the doors! - They're closed. Try again, keep trying! Keep trying, Brahim! Fuck! - Come on! - We got him! This way! Hey, he's over here! He's here, come on! Open the door! - Knock it down! - Open up, bitch! - Come out here, you son of a bitch! - Break down the door! Open up, asshole! I don't have a choice. - I don't have a choice! - Get him! What's going on? He jumped out of a window? - Brahim, are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - I just ate shit, but I'm out. - Get out of there! Stay on the phone, we'll be there in ten minutes. Okay? I found a way out. I'm getting out! I'm gonna get... Done! - We warned you, asshole. - He's knocked out. Shit! I'll give you water, but keep quiet. Okay? - I'm gonna kill you... - No. Fuck, Stan. Play it. Look where your brother is. Give me my son back or the dogs will rip him apart! Stop! Stop! Stop, come on! Please, don't hurt me, please! No, fuck! Now, gentlemen, I have to admit that we are screwed. Réda! Fuck... Call them back and tell them exactly what I tell you, okay? No. - I have a better idea. - No, I'm sure you don't. Yes, I do. I don't think your friends understand how serious I am. Go ahead. Piece of shit. Stop! No! Let me go! Stop! So, you want to feed my brother to your dogs? Okay, then I'll feed your son to the sharks. My dad's gonna kill you, asshole! Sharks, moron! Dad! Hey! Stop! Son of a bitch! Yeah, whatever. So, what do we do now? - Wanna do an exchange? - You piece of shit, I'm gonna kill you! Get him back on the boat! It's up to you, but hurry up. Chafik. Okay! We'll do an exchange. There you go! Now you're being reasonable! Unbelievable... Guys, there are things here! Get me out of here! Hey! A shark! Help me! Help me! There's a shark! I'm on the phone. I'm warning you... If there's even one hair missing... A big one's behind him. - He'll be fine, I promise. - There's... Nothing will happen to him! Shut up! Ciao. We have to get him out, a big one is coming. - Fuck! - Help me! - Come! - Come on! - Why didn't you tell me? - I did! Crawl! - Fuck, he can't swim! - Swim, faster! - Help me! - It's coming straight at him! - Jesus! - Help me! - Come on! - Hurry up! - Swim! - Come on! Come on, hurry! - Come on! - Come on! That was really close! That was close! What's wrong? What's going on? We could say it wasn't our fault. I don't know... Should we stop the bleeding? - Yes, on both legs. - Right. The closest hospital is 30 kilometers away. - He won't make it. Anything closer? - A vet. - A vet? - Yes! Sir, it's an emergency! We're closed. He was bitten by a shark. Please, he's gonna die! - No, but I have to go eat. - Come on! I have to go. I'm closing. No! This is a vet clinic! - This is not... - Open the door, please! - No! - Open! This is a vet... Hello, I'm Bernardo Gutiérrez, I'm a veterinarian and animal lover. And today, I'd like to recommend the best kibble with the best vitamins! THE KIBBLE Delicious, amazing, exquisite and very nutritious... High in magnesium, high in zinc, high in vitamins. Vitamins! A lot of vitamins! He wants to do the exchange tomorrow, in the old Medellín cemetery. Great. We'll exchange Brahim for half his son? They don't know half is missing. They're gonna notice pretty quick. Let me get some rest, please. Hello? This is Cynthia from Barraputa, what have you done? - I still don't speak Spanish. - Did you kidnap a man? I didn't, but my friend... Are you insane? Why did you do that? To exchange him for his brother, I told you. Exchange him? Who have you been talking to? - His father. - His father? You spoke to his father? - When is the exchange? - Tomorrow. - Where? - At the old Medellín cemetery. Why do you want to know? And why are you upset? Hello? We'll be there in ten minutes. I know where El Diablo will be tomorrow. Hey, there. Why are you all alone in a cage? Hey, can you translate this for me? - Fuck, I'm sleeping. - Please. They're gonna put this dog down, she was abandoned. Sir. How is he? - I've ligatured the arteries... - Okay. - ...and bandaged what's left of his legs. - Yes. But he lost a lot of blood. If he doesn't get a transfusion quickly, he's gonna die. He needs blood or he will die. Blood? Where can we find blood? - Maybe... - No. I would love to, but I've donated a lot lately, - so I can't do it. - Okay. And you? You look full of blood. - Me? - Yes, well... I've had a lot of unprotected sex, that wouldn't help. - I mean... - Yeah? - It's not that I don't... - Don't worry, gentlemen. I'm a universal donor. I'll save that man's life. What? - That's great. - Of course. Doctor, let's not waste time. I got it. He looks like an empty Capri Sun. - That's it! - Right? Enough... I don't think he'll make it. - Who, him? - No, him! He's a small man, but he's strong. No. Enough... Empty. - Five more minutes, please. - Sons of bitches! - Shit. - There. Help me. Those men chose me... He's ratting us out. - Help me! They fed me to the sharks. - No! Yes! - No. Wait a minute. - What's going on? - They had me swimming for my life! - No! And then... Assholes... Are you sure he's your friend? Of course he is! An old friend. - Yes, an old friend! - Right... - We have to go. - Okay. - No. I'm not... - Yes. Thank you, sir! Grab the meds! He's just as heavy when he's empty. Come on! He fits perfectly now. I don't feel good. I need to eat. No! - Why'd you bring her? - They were gonna kill her. - Get her out of here. - She won't hurt you. You remember the plan? Yes, but tell me again. - I'll confirm that Brahim's in the car. - Right. I'll come back and they'll send a guy to do the same. We exchange keys and we leave in their car. It's gonna work. - Yeah, I mean... - It's gonna work. Yeah, okay. Don't do anything crazy. - My friend's watching you. - You're gonna die anyway. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Don't worry. Did they do anything to you? Come on, move it. Okay, stop yelling. It's over. This is the end. - Let's get out of here. - I'm sorry. Don't worry, brother. We're here. Well, it was nice meeting you, and we're sorry for the inconvenience. Relax, it's gonna be fine. He's calling us over. Let's go. - And the keys? - We stole the car, I don't have the keys. No! No! Kill them! Hurry, get those motherfuckers! - What about Brahim? - Run, now! Fuck! They're heading to the Escobar district. Come on! Guys, wait for me! You're going too fast! Wait. Come on! - Hurry! - Wait for me! Hurry up! Let's go. This way. Fuck, I'm not gonna make it. Come back here! Help me! Hurry up! There! Die! Thank God these assholes can't shoot! Hey! Okay. This way? What are you doing here, motherfuckers? Talk to him. Calm down, sir. We're tourists, this is a misunderstanding. - Come on. - Hey! - Should we help? - No, he's doing fine. I'll finish him off and we can go! Son of a bitch! Wait. - Take care of him. - Why me? You're closer. Come on! Fuck! Come on! Don't do anything stupid. Come on, drive! Where are you going? You got this! Fuck! No! Motherfucker! You're not gonna do this, right? Don't do this! Let's go! Let's go! Get in, come on. - Hold on! - Wait. Come on! Hurry up! Jump! Fuck... Stop! Stop it, now! Come on! My brother's dead. They killed my brother. Wait, she's a cop? Are you a cop? Where is your backup? They're not coming. It's just me. So, shut up, I need to think. Fuck... Sorry, boss. A dog bit me. - Don't worry. I understand. - Thank you. Where are we going? I'm taking you to the border with Venezuela. I'm sorry about your brother. My boss didn't authorize the operation to go save you. They're corrupt. Corrupt? Okay, I get it. Thank you, cops! Listen to me! I took huge risk for you! Without me, you'd be dead. She's got a point. I've danced for a year in that crappy bar to get close to Don Nacho. I was tracking his father. But now we're all fired and my investigation's ruined. Hey, they took my brother! Of course! You kidnapped his son! What did you expect? Whatever. Now, they're gonna kill you and your whole family! Don't you get it? What did she say? That the Narcos will come after our families in France. - That's bullshit. - It's happened before, the same story. - There's an article about it. - So, what's your genius idea? Kidnap their mother so they don't kill ours? I found it. In 2012, narcos went to Marseille to settle old scores and in the end... it was a massacre. What about her? What's gonna happen to her? I don't know, she was supposed to be put down today. She's better off with us, right? Even if we are a mess... Your name is not really Cynthia. No, my name is Marissa. Okay, Marissa, why did you come to help us? My investigation is ruined. My department's corrupt. I wasn't gonna let El Diablo kill you. I'm sorry. We thought Brahim was in danger. I'm sorry for you guys. Thank you for helping us. Stan! I got a video from Brahim's number! To avenge my son... - No... - What is this? ...I'll destroy your lives. I'm gonna kill every member of your family. - Slow deaths... - Fuck, no... ...and painful ones! Starting with your brother! They're all going to suffer like my son suffered! Now, if you want to end this, you know where to find me. We're turning ourselves in. That won't help at all. They'll get revenge no matter what you do. Then what do we do? Wait for them to smash my brother's head in? We can't let him die, we have to do something. There's a guy... The only guy in Colombia who can help you. But... No "Buts." We don't have a choice. What kind of a guy lives alone in a house this big? The discreet kind who doesn't like to be bothered. So, do what I tell you, man. What did she say? He's not the kind of guy you mess around with. Let's go. This way. There's no one here. It's locked. Hey! Robbie! Hey, stop! I'm Marissa. My dad was your teammate in the fight against narcos. We met when I was a child. We're not here to compromise your safehouse. We just need your help. Please. My God, you have grown! Get over here and give me a hug! It's all right. - You're not fighting him too? - He seems nice, there's no need. - He's staring at you. - No, at you. - What? - He's staring but in a nice way. Say something. - Great house. - Great. So, in short, there's no choice. That's why we're here, asking you for help. Because we ain't got anything. We don't know where he is, we don't know how to deal with El Diablo to free him. The only thing we know is that every minute we waste brings his brother closer to death. Are you really ready to do anything to save your family? What did he say? He's asking who your favorite family member is. Not at all. He asked if you'd do anything for them. Right. Yes, I'm ready. Who is this guy? What is this crazy place? It's a secret US Army base. Robbie's fought the narcos all his life. But why is he still here in Colombia? His daughter lives here. She's involved in politics and he doesn't want to leave her. Gentlemen, after this mission, you'll erase me from your memory. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Clear. This for me? I like yours. Okay, thank you. - Yours is better. - Mine has a gun sight. - Yours is better. - Let's swap. - Give it to me. - No. Shut the fuck up! - It's him. - No, it's him. No, it was you! It's not a fucking game. Come on, hold this fucking shit right. Okay. Look, I want to fight too. Take it easy. We got a better position for you in this mission. Really? - Ready? - Yes. Let's go. Okay, let's do it. - You, first. - No, you go first. - Honestly, it's the same to me. - Well, if it's the same, then go. Come on, shoot the fucking gun! Yes, Mister, but... we are normal people, not soldiers. Aim at the target, shoot, or I'll blow your fucking brains out. Now. Okay. Okay. Now you know you can shoot, right? Your turn. Okay, I'll shoot. Practice for an hour. Don't miss. Come on. First part of the plan will be to locate Brahim. The second part will be to exfiltrate him. Last but not least will be the escape. So, one of us will have to go there and play as bait. You will lead us inside with a GPS inside you. And this will be a success. A GPS inside me? - But... inside where? - Up your ass. - In my ass? - Yes. The safest place in the world. - If it's necessary, we must do it. - We can't say no. - It's very small. - Does it hurt? No, of course! He's a professional. - He's done it many times. - It's a regular thing in the Army. We would have done it, but he chose you... Come on! He's done it many times. He knows what he's doing. You should be proud, man. We would have done it, but he chose you... Such a hero. Okay, fine. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congrats, you... - You have the best part of the mission. - Yeah, but... I'm happy for you. Guys... Help me! Bathroom! - Shut those dogs up! - Toilet, please! - Careful with that Mastiff. - It's urgent! Give them all food. No... - The kid is yelling. - Let him rot. Guys! No! Sons of bitches! Guys! I'm gonna load the car. The assholes are here! Where is my brother? Tell me! I know where it is. Okay, good. Shall we go? Good luck, guys. Good luck? But... You don't come with us? Sorry, gentlemen. This is your shit. You deal with it. But I will be connected with you on the field. It's gonna be fine though. It's not the same without him. I believe in you. Give me your best job. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. I'll see you there for the final part of the plan. I hope so. Please, be careful. Come on, man! Get your shit together! It's now or never! Brahim! Hey, Brahim, are you there? Can you hear me? Listen to me, we're coming to get you, bro. We've got a crazy plan. It's gonna work. Just to be sure... you realize what we're about to do? It's make-or-break time. That's right. And you were right. I'm a crappy operations leader. At leading anything, actually. You can be in charge. Do you copy? Do you copy? Yes, Robbie. It's time. Take out the drone. Okay. This way. Come on. There? Look left. Left! In here! Turn on your camera. Your brother's on the second floor. Take the tunnel, ready? Yeah. Okay, let's go. Good luck, guys. Go on! Get him! - That's it! - Yeah! Follow the wall, discreetly. He is right in front of you. - He's here. - He's fucking alive! He's right there! - Let's go. - No. What do we do about him? Take him out. You can take him. You can take him. Come on! Stan! I'm right here! Stan! Hello, sir. No! Easy! - Who are you? - No, it's okay. I'm looking for a friend. - Back off, asshole. - A little guy with a mustache. There he is. Good punch! I'm here. Wow! Great take down! Don't let up! He's winning! Hey, let's go! I'm coming. Come on. Hurry! Get out of there now! We're coming out! We're coming. Come on! Here! This way! Réda, blow up this door. Go hide. Yeah! Well done, guys. All right, come on! We did it! Yes! Yeah! Okay, drive! Guys... - Guys! - What? Where's the dwarf? The dwarf, well, he's... He's not... The dwarf is... Well... What? - What? - You want to leave him there, you asshole? - I didn't say that. - I saw that! It doesn't mean anything. You want to leave him. - I saw you! - It was you! - Your eyes were like this... - No, it was you! - You should be ashamed. - It was you! You want to abandon him, I'm ready to go get him. - You want to go? - Yes, I want to go. Then go. We'll wait here. Aren't you coming? Please? Robbie, we have a problem. I know. We have to adapt. Plan B, now. Brahim, listen to me very carefully. You wait for us here. If something goes wrong for us... - you run. - Okay. You take my phone and you call Marissa. Okay, Marissa. - Can I come with you? - No. They fucking forgot me, those assholes! Motherfucker! Go up! We'll take them from the top! Come on! Go up! Come on! Shit, where are we? That's where they manufacture coke. Get out of there! - We have to go. - Open the door! Come on. Over here! Motherfucker! - Over there! - Come on! - Shit! We're screwed. - No, we're fine. - It's locked! - Smash the fucking lock! - There are two guys in the stairs. - No... No! Kill them or they're gonna kill you. No, I won't shoot anyone. - Goddamn shoot them! - I won't kill them. I won't shoot. It's you or them. - No! - Shoot now! Fuck. We're good. We're good, come on! Come on! I killed people. Don't think about it. Remember, it's only the beginning. On your left. - They're here. - We have no choice. Motherfucker! Many others are coming! Help me! - We need more men! - I see him! Shoot them! Go, go, go! Come on! I have more ammo. Finish him, Tony! Let's go. Shoot that fucker! There he is, behind the door! Shit! We need backup! Surround that motherfucker! Your time has... Here they come! First cage on your left. - It's locked. - Get back. Get back! We're good! I got him! - Go! - Come on! - Careful, they're coming! - Wait! - I'm out of bullets. - I know. Don't let them breathe! - Okay. - Brother! - Come on. - Wait. I got one too! - Come on. - The last one. It's not a game! - You played, I want to play too! - Let's go! Come on! This way. We're good. There's still one man. It's over! - Guys... - It's over now. - Why aren't you shooting? - I'm out of ammo. - I have a grenade. - No, that's enough of that. What do we do? I got it. Friend. We have two guns, you only have one. Drop your gun... and fight, one on one. Okay. At the same time. Okay, drop your gun. What did you tell him? I told him you'd fight him one on one. - You can take him. - No, together. - Gentlemen, I'm here too. - Okay, we'll do it together. Okay, I'll take the winner. Okay, come on. Beautiful! - Did you see that? I knocked him out! - We'll done! We got him. Let's go, come on! Come on! - Are you okay? - I'm okay... - We have a problem. - Yeah. He has legs. - We need another plan. Fast. - Wait. Come on. Kick his legs! Okay... No... Oh yeah. - Where is he? - Come on, get up. - Right in front of you. - Come on. - Did I win? - Sure. - You won. - Good. Okay. It's okay, then. No, my friend! No! Calm down. Take it... easy. Oh, shit! Wow! In your face! Come on, guys. Let's go! Come on! Get up, come on! Why don't we just leave the country now? We need to finish this or they'll track us down. Hey, guys, do you copy? I'm losing you. Yes, Robbie. Well done, guys. Good luck for the future. - Okay. - The mission is not over, you know what you gotta do now. Good luck. Thank you so much, Robbie. You are the boss. Guys, do you know where we are? It's one of Escobar's houses, I've seen pictures. - Okay. - So that's the final plan. Marissa, this is Brahim. Sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go. Wow! Do you realize all the crazy stuff that must have happened here? Are you ready? Yes, almost. It's unbelievable. Guys... there's a secret passage. What do you mean? I saw it in the documentary about Escobar. Try it. Unbelievable. I told you. He was a genius. A genius. It's just a door to the garden. - Wow... - Robbie was right. Now, we just need to take off. Fucking hell! It's El Patrón's helicopter. Chafik, lend me your phone. It still works. Can you fly it? I have time to learn. I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, and you're the first to find... Stop, fuck! Stop! Can't you be a fan of someone else? Pablo Escobar, Tony Montana, they're shit! Be a fan of someone who does good things! Why are you so upset? What the... Where did I go wrong with you? What were you thinking? Why did you pretend to be kidnapped? You know, it's... for the followers... To get more fans... - To go viral. - Stop with this viral shit! - Stop! - I didn't think you'd come after me. Or that it would be such a mess... If I made such a mess, it's because the idea of anything happening to you... makes me lose my shit. I... - I messed up. - Yeah. - I messed up. - I messed up too. Big time. I love you, brother. I love you too. Let's go home. I want to go home. You sure it's going to be okay? We'll find out soon. Réda. We have a problem. What problem? What problem? I can't promise anything, but I think I can do it. Let's finish this then. Let's go. - Are you okay? - Yes, of course. Okay, let's go. - The house needs to be visible. - Yeah. We're good. Ready? Okay. Boss, we have 16 dead bodies and the French escaped. Boss, look at this. You underestimated the French. Where are the narcos now? You got your asses kicked by a dwarf! I could have finished this whole thing by myself! - Yeah, totally! - Yeah! Let's be clear, we don't want to hear from you again. - That's right! - Alaikum Salaam, Narcos! - Is that the estate of... - I know! Listen up! I want every man here with me. The whole cartel. All the guns. I'm going to destroy them. - Let's go! - Go, go! Thank you. Thanks for everything. We don't know each other very well, but I'm alive thanks to you. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. I can't take you with me. Take care of her, okay? And... she doesn't date clients, but I'm not one... and she's not a stripper, so... it could have worked between us. We'll never know. Take care of her. Thank you for your help. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Really? Just like that? At least... Good? Okay, now that we're in the helicopter, I'd like to talk about the controls. The first one is my left handle and this is called the collective stick. What actually happens with this one, I can raise this collective stick and lower it back down again... - Our friends are here. - Copy that. Starting the engine. - I'm ready to go. - Let's do it. Let's go, cover the right side! - Let's go! - Kill them all! I want no one alive. Take care of them! Now! Shoot them! Let's go! You finally found me. Come on. They can't have gone far! - Is Réda coming? - He's going through the roof. Follow them! Find him, come on! Boss! The rotation, on one horizontal plane, left and right... By using my left and right pedals... Réda, they're here! Hurry, what are you doing? Come on! I can't come. What are you talking about? Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here! I can't activate the device from outside the house. What are you saying? - Get out of there! - They're armored walls. The signal won't get through, Escobar did it for his safety. I've lured them in here, as we planned, but... I have to blow it up from the inside. I won't leave without you. Do you hear me? I won't leave! Hurry up! It's too late. I have no choice. Get out of here. Get out of here, Stan. Stan, just fucking go! Now! Listen, if you don't go now, you're gonna die too. Stan, what are you doing? Don't fucking do that! What about Réda? Cut the bullshit! Stop! What are you doing? I want to talk to Brahim. Stan, I'm gonna jump! Why did you take off? Stan, stop! - Réda! - Brahim, little brother. Brahim, take care of Mom, okay? - No... - Take good care of her. And I love you. No, Réda, wait! Please! Listen to me. Listen, I... No, Réda! Réda! This is bullshit, talk to me! Stan! Stan, stop! Stan, please! - Open up! - What's going on? Stop! Stay here, I'll go alone. I'll win, you son of a bitch. Get up. No. You shouldn't have messed with me. Get up! Go rot in hell with fucking Escobar! No! Réda! And voilà. That's how three ordinary street kids ended up destroying the worst cartel in Medellín. Okay, let's go! Again! Good. Small jumps, keep going, come on!
