[woman humming] HANNAH: Where did you learn that? ESME: Something I heard in a dream. HANNAH: That's Emily's song. ESME: Who's Emily? [music] ESME: You never told me you had a sister. HANNAH: No, I suppose not. ESME: Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Mom! HANNAH: Yes, love? ESME: Where are we going? How do you know where we are? When are we going to get there? I told you I feel fine. I don't need fresh air. HANNAH: Fresh air will do you some good. ESME: I don't feel sick. Really. HANNAH: You'll see the big rock... the lake. We're going to the farm. [whispered voice] Esme. ESME: But why? HANNAH: I've wanted you to see it for a very long time. It's ah, it's where we're from. ESME: I just want to go home. I'm tired. HANNAH: Esme? I thought I had a little more time to tell you this. I thought... we had a little more time. [ominous music] [car horn] HANNAH: Esme? Esme, you know that... I love you. ESME: I don't- HANNAH: I love you, okay? I love you and I would never, never do anything to hurt you, right? Not on purpose. Not if I didn't have- ESME: Hannah! That clingy thing! HANNAH: [sigh] Yeah, well... somethings that clingy thing is important. [car horn] [tires skidding] [banging noises] [deep breathing] [crickets] [birds chirping] [car engine revving] [deep breaths] [engine stops] [birds chirping] [deep breaths] [rustling] [car door opening] Esme? [eerie music] [sneeze] Bless you. [birds chirping] HANNAH: It's beautiful, right? [yawns] [eerie music] HANNAH: All of this used to be ours. All of it. Isn't it amazing? ESME: I guess so. Can you tell me about Emily? HANNAH: Well, she loves the forest... and exploring. Just like you. That used to be her mirror, you know? ESME: Really? HANNAH: She used to say it let her see things for what they really were. ESME: What's that supposed to mean? HANNAH: Oh, I don't know. ESME: Is it magic? [music, women humming] HANNAH: I don't know. [music, women humming] [acoustic guitar] HANNAH: Emily used to love trees. ESME: Did she have a favorite? HANNAH: Sycamores probably. Those are the easiest to climb. And ferns. Those aren't trees but... Emily loved ferns. [running footsteps] Is this a sycamore? You should feel the bark on this one! It's really prickly. ESME: I like our forest! HANNAH: Esme, wait! HANNAH: Funny, you think you know a place and then it changes on you. Hey! Esme! Shh. It's okay. It's just... you look so much like her. So? You know how important you are to me, right? ESME: Hannah, you're being clingy. - HANNAH: No, look, sorry. It's just- - ESME: Hannah! Mom. Call me Mom. Okay? HANNAH: Let's go to the right. [rustling] ESME: Are we gonna be there soon? Look, I just need you to be good, okay? Just for today, please. ESME: [mumbling] Just wanted to know where we're gonna meet her. HANNAH: It's far to the lake. We're gonna need to find a place to rest. [wind blowing] [music] [fire crackling] Hello there, sleepyhead. [pot banging] Can you show me the lake? You'll see it soon. Can you? We have to keep moving. Already? [pot clanging] Are we going home soon? Are we going home soon? Hannah? [music crescendos] Are we going home soon? Hannah? [yelp] Ow! [fire crackling] HANNAH: You're so beautiful. You're right. There's no hurry. Not yet, anyway. I can show you the big rock today. Would you like that? [metal clanging] [wind] [birds chirp] [atmospheric music] Wow. This is... I haven't been here in years. It's like looking into yesterday. But... the tree's in the way. All this used to be farmland, just fields... And cows, mostly. Big, fat cows. Did you and Emily used to come here a lot? Yeah, we used to race up the hill to get here. Grandpa used to say that this rock crowns the hillside. Isn't that a nice phrase? "This rock crowns the hillside." Always very poetic, Grandpa. It's nice how some things last forever. Except of course without all the... Esme? Esme? Esme?! [atmospheric music] [rustling] [whispered voice] Esme. [gasp] What did I say about disappearing? - I... - You can't just wander off! [crickets] Esme, are you done? ESME: No! Well hurry up. ESME: Well it's not my fault Number Two takes so long! [wood cracks] ESME: Hannah? What? ESME: What's this? [gasp] Oh my goodness! This is a little garden shovel. Did I ever tell you you come from a family of diggers? HANNAH: Okay. This looks like a good spot to dig. It's usually better to dig near existing structures. ESME: Why? There's a better chance someone left something nearby. See? Here. You try. [crickets] [buzzing fly] ESME: Weren't you gonna take me to the lake? We can get to the lake later. I want to show you something first. But why not after? Come on! You'll like it. [peaceful music] Can we sail it? Maybe. Later? It's beautiful, right? [music, women humming] [door opening] HANNAH: This looks like a good spot for digging. [footsteps] HANNAH: Help yourself. Go ahead. Anywhere you like. Go ahead. It's fun. [digging] HANNAH: Whoa. What is it? That... That's the bottle cap to our family's milk bottle. See? The family logo? Isn't it cool? Don't you see? It's like... like a sign. - Of what? - It's like... My past is connecting with us. A tiny piece of something... that doesn't exist anymore. Okay? - [whispers] We're not really alone. - What? Yeah! [laughs] We're not alone, are we? The past, the past can speak to us. - Change our minds, maybe even change our plans- - Hannah! Mom. You call me Mom. Take good care of it. Make sure not to lose it. [digging sounds] HANNAH: No way. They left some peaches! ESME: Who did? Grandma and Grandpa. Oh, you're gonna love these. Aren't they old? Nah. Canned goods last forever. [retching] HANNAH: I'm so sorry, Esme. - ESME: I really don't feel good. - HANNAH: No, no, no. [retching] [rustling] [floorboards creaking] Esme? Wait! [groans] [creaking door] [gags] [acoustic guitar] [rain] [floorboards creaking] [thunder] ESME: Hannah, when are we leaving? Hannah? Hannah! [gasp] [coughing] [rustling] [music fades] Esme? Hi! Hey baby girl. You know you're my favorite thing, right? Oh yeah? Mmhmm. More than... chocolate cake? Mmm. It's a tough choice. Or sand under your toes? You feeling better? Am I feeling better? [footsteps] ESME: Did you used to live here? Once upon a time. ESME: It's all super old. ESME: What's this? [gasp] [ringing noise] What? Why are you looking at me all weird? Nothing, I just... [ringing noise] Yep. Still a fever. The doctor orders you to sleep! HANNAH: Esme... Sorry. [whispers] I'll be quiet! [whimpering] [sniffling] ESME: [echoey] Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! HANNAH: Esme? Esme? [ominous music] [scream] [crying] [wind] HANNAH: Here. That's better. ESME: I don't get it. HANNAH: Get what? ESME: Why did our family dig? HANNAH: What do you mean? ESME: It's weird. HANNAH: No it's not! It's fun. It's exciting. You find things that have no right to exist anymore. Survivors. It's still weird. HANNAH: I just wish we had more time. ESME: You're being clingy. HANNAH: You need to let me, Esme. ESME: Why? You won't be my little girl forever. Isn't that a good thing? I don't know. [wind] [chimes] Did I tell you? Like silver glass. [canoe creaking] HANNAH: There once were two little girls. They both were a lot like you. And they were the best of friends. Sisters. And they loved the forest. A majestic forest. Full of fish who lived in the lake... and birds who lived in the sky... and spirits who lived in the trees. The spirits of their darkest fears. And biggest dreams. A forgotten world. [birds chirping] [chimes] [thud] HANNAH: Here we go. Now we just gotta find a good place to camp before the sun goes down. [ominous music] HANNAH: You know, Grandpa used to love- [yelp] [splash] ESME: [scream] Hannah! Hannah! Help! Hannah! Mom! [crash] [ringing sound] [eerie music] [gasp] [splash] [music] It's okay. It's okay. [coughing] HANNAH: We gotta get you dry, okay? Shh. It's okay. Come here. [panting] [rustling] [shivering] [owl hooting] Mom? Shh. Go back to sleep baby. - But... - It's alright. Everything's gonna be alright. [crickets] Mom? Shh. It's okay baby. Go back to sleep, Esme. There's no hurry. No hurry at all. [music] [laughs] [playful music] [heavy breathing] [music, women humming] [splash] Well? Well?! [playful music] Wait! [door slams] [laugh] [ringing] [gentle music] [gravel crunching] Mom? Mom, where are you? [digging sounds] Mom! Mom! [eerie music] Mom! Mom, mom, mom! [screaming] - [panting] - Shh. Hey, everything's gonna be okay now. You're all better now. You're gonna be okay, okay? I see what to do, baby. I see what to do. [whispers] Hey, hey. See? For you, baby. Esme, everything's perfect. [sobbing] [wind] ESME: Are we going home? HANNAH: No, no! There's so much more to show you, so much to learn. ESME: What do you mean? [eerie music] HANNAH: We have to dig. HANNAH: The world is a strange place, Esme. So confusing without guidance. Without lamps to light our way. [eerie music] Our family's roots run deep. Now, they're all but forgotten. HANNAH: One, two, three, four, five. [digging sounds] [clunk] [gentle music] [clanging of metal box opening] What do you remember about Grandma and Grandpa? Emily and me. We were inseparable. I followed her everywhere like... sunshine and her shadow HANNAH: And one more... Now who could that be, I wonder? How quickly mothers fall in love with their children. Hey, but I was- Do you know what this is? This is a Saint Christopher medal. He watches over travelers and he protects wanderers. It's our family's oldest possession. Passed on from generation to generation. Always to the oldest daughter. From your great-great-grandmother to your great-grandmother... all the way down to Emily. And now... to you. How about that? Gotta keep moving. Can't sit here dwelling on the past. What's wrong? HANNAH: Just need to keep moving. [music, women humming] [water] HANNAH: Come on, baby. Let's go. ESME: [shivers] It's cold! HANNAH: It's not too cold! Look! HANNAH: Whoo! [heavy breathing] HANNAH: Come on, get in here! [ominous music] HANNAH: I think it's important that we do this. She needs us! [gasping] HANNAH: Esme, come on! [muffled voices] - ESME: No, no - HANNAH: One, two... - HANNAH: Esme, listen to me- - ESME: I can't swim! I'm gonna- HANNAH: I know, baby. But you can't let fear in! [ringing noise] [splash] HANNAH: Esme! You did baby. You did it! ESME: I did it! - ESME: It's cold. - HANNAH: Oh you did so good, baby. Come here. - HANNAH: Okay... - ESME: Mom! - HANNAH: Okay, that's it! HANNAH: All done. It's all done now. HANNAH: It's all better now. [bird songs] [splash] [splash] HANNAH: I thought for sure someone woulda left something. [splashing] HANNAH: This is the life, huh? Hannah, what are you doing? I feel so much younger. Better than I have in years. The answers, they're out here, calling to us. Just tell me what you know. [laughs] And you... you look so perfect. [laughs] ESME: But when? HANNAH: We're getting somewhere, Esme. Why would you want to go back? ESME: This is taking forever. Can't we just look at the farmhouse again? HANNAH: Stop whining. [digging sounds] [ringing sound] [eerie music] [panicked panting] [panting] [eerie music] [heavy breathing] [old piano notes] [piano strings] [jarring music] [whisper] Jane Eyre. [clears throat] "I am not an angel, I asserted... and I will not be one until I die... I will be myself, Mister Rochester." "Today, I ate three crab apples without getting sick... it was lovely." "There are no poems as pretty as trees... but this book comes awful close." "Darling Esme. Two months." [digging sounds] [ominous sounds] [acoustic guitar] Ah. No worry. We'll eat soon. I promise. [digging sounds] [creaky footsteps] ESME: "No sight so sad as a naughty child, he began... especially a naughty little girl." [digging sounds] "Do you know where the wicked go after death?" [buzzing] [digging noises] ESME: "They go to hell." [heavy breathing] ESME: "And what must you do you avoid it?" "I deliberated a moment... - "My answer when it did come was objectionable." - [Hannah panting and laughing] "I must keep in good health and not die." [bang] [rhythmic ringing] [bang] [rhythmic ringing] "Everybody says she looks just like me... but I didn't see it until today, in our reflection in the water." [eerie music] [laughs] ESME: [whisper] I've realized that this mirror is magic. [haunting music] ESME: Shoot. Shoot, shoot, shoot! [crickets] [owl hooting] HANNAH: The pie was still warm on the windowsill. That was the oddest part. The woman dead as a doorknob... and a crying baby covered in its mother's blood. It was locked from the inside and the husband- - I'm sorry, I'm late- - Did you like that story? Story? HANNAH: That's the scariest one I know. - Are you alright? - Unless of course you count the other one. You didn't even realize. The one about Emily. ESME: Emily? She died. What? HANNAH: She died horribly. Blood oozing out of every pore. Suffocating on her own bile. It always starts with the eyes, of course. They glaze over and then they turn white and you start to see things. You lose your mind, your memory, your muscles. Mom. It eats you up from the inside out. Mom! What a horrible family we have. Our own personal genetic mutation. That's enough! She said... how long as Emily been dead? - I don't understand. - Well we were gonna meet her and- Why are we even here if she's dead? [crescendoing eerie music] [clanging] HANNAH: What's wrong? How can you even ask that question? I don't understand. Everything's alright. Everything's not alright, or perfect, or wonderful. What are you talking about? We're not here on vacation! And the person you want me to meet is dead! We still need to trust her. Who? Emily? She's speaking to us. ESME: What do you mean? She's dead. You just told me she died! The past it's never really gone. It can be changed... - fixed. - Mom! Don't you trust me? For god's sake. I'm your mother. So? Fine. ESME: Fine! [animal noises] [music, women humming] [whisper] Esme, Esme. [gasp] [crickets] "I've always liked sunrises. My sister says sunsets are prettier... But there's no real possibility in a sunset." "When I hold her, I can feel her heart beating so fast... like a little mouse's." HANNAH: Oh! Esme! Esme! ESME: What? What?! What is it? HANNAH: There was the most beautiful little water snake! I feel as if she was just about to say something to me, you know? [ominous sounds] "My sister, of course, is the more natural athlete... but I think I'm more graceful, and I can climb much higher in trees." HANNAH: It was horrible watching her writhe around in bed like that. She used to be such a beautiful creature. ESME: "Sometimes, I lie awake at night and... wonder what happens to us when we die." HANNAH: She had a real grace to the way she moved. ESME: "And I wonder about my darling little girl... My love." HANNAH: But in the end she got what she wanted. ESME: "I am no bird... and no net ensnares me. I am a free human being." HANNAH: She escaped. ESME: "This book is the property of... Emily." [haunting music] ESME: "I could tell she was hungry but I didn't know what to feed her." "I can see things that no one else can see." [chuckle] HANNAH: You done yet? Mom! What are you doing? Hey, we don't have much food left! You call this garbage food? Come on, Mom! Uh, uh, uh. Mind your elders. Come on, we have to go. [shovel scrapping] - This is mine. - I know, I- Let go. - I know, I just- - Let go! Just calm down, Mom! I said let go! [glass shattering] [ominous music] Esme? Esme, sweetie. Mommy didn't mean that. I'm so sorry! HANNAH: Esme, wait! Wait, baby I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you- Come on, baby. I can help fix it! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you. Please come out. Esme, baby, I'm sorry! Baby girl! [slam] [ringing noise] [heavy breathing] HANNAH: Baby, I'm sorry! Baby, come on, I'm so sorry. Esme? Come on baby, mommy didn't mean it. [haunting music] Esme, are you okay? You need to tell me what's really going on! - Oh sweetie. - No! Now! You need to tell me why we're here in this stupid forest! - Esme, I told you. We came here because- - No, no, stop lying! We're almost out of food and you're running around like a lunatic! - I am not running around- - You need to wake up and take care of me! Oh, Esme. That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm doing all of this for you. - No! - To take care of you! Everything is alright. Everything's wonderful! - Everything is not wonderful! - There's so much to see. There's so much to do. - We can see the j- - Who's Emily?! Who is she really? And what is that stupid book! What are you talking about? This book! This book that Emily wrote! Where did you get this? There's notes in the spaces. There's notes from Emily, there's notes about you, and notes about me! Emily's favorite book... Who is Emily?! Baby girl- Tell me! This is Emily. [whimper] How could, how could you- Sweetie, I'm so sorry. It's alright. Hey, it's alright, baby. Alright. It's okay. [music] Esme. - What?! - You have her eyes. - How could you? - She died a horrible death. I wanted to save you from a horrible death. But now I know I don't have to save you. We have to save her. - What? - We have to save Emily. We have to dig! The past never really dies, right? Come here. HANNAH: Can't you feel that? She's calling to us. She needs us to find her. She died! She's gone! She hid. Isn't that wonderful? We're coming! Wait, Mom! [acoustic guitar] Shit. [thunder] [digging noises] [haunting music] [groans, digging noises] ESME: "Every atom of your flesh is dear to me as my own." [digging noises] [groan] ESME: "In pain and sickness it would still be dear." HANNAH: Find it. Find it. [digging noises] HANNAH: How can I abandon you? [frantic digging] How can I leave you behind? [groans, digging] Come on! You're here, come on! Just dig! [whisper] Esme HANNAH: Agh, dig! Dig! Esme. My love. [fire crackling] [sniff] HANNAH: [screaming] Come on! Stop hiding! It's not funny anymore! [pages ripping] [digging] HANNAH & ESME: "The soul fortunately has an interpreter... [ominous sounds] unconscious but faithful interpreter... in the eye." [loud ringing] [haunting music] [digging noises] Mom? [digging] Mom? Hannah? She's here. She's here. [ringing] You know, it's time to go home. We need to leave. - Hannah, it's time to go home. - We are home. - Hannah, we need to go home! - We are home. - Hannah! - No! [Esme screams] [shovel bangs] You can't make me, Emily. You can't make me! ESME: Wait! [laughing] [Esme screams] - Isn't it wonderful? [laughs] - Hannah! [heavy breathing] [Esme screams] [whispered] She's here. I found her. [laughs] I can taste it. She's here. I can taste it. So very close. [Esme screams] Hannah! [panicked breathing] [Esme screams] - She's here. [laughs] She's here. She's here. She's here. I found her. [laughs] [screaming] [ominous music] [crickets] [eerie music] [heavy breathing] Esme? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Esme. HANNAH: Everything's alright now, right? Everything's okay. ESME: Yeah. Everything's alright now. HANNAH: I found her. You found her. Yeah. Yeah, I did. HANNAH: [whisper] Everything's wonderful. [rustling] [crickets] [haunting music] [panicked breathing] [whimpering] [ringing noise] [gasp] [panicked breathing] [music, woman humming] [ominous music] [birds chirping, water] [wind] [acoustic guitar] [water splashing] [gentle music] [wind] [acoustic guitar] VOCALIST: Lucky girl... in a good neighborhood... she doesn't care about what she's got. Lucky girl... in a bad state of mind. Walks around and tells people I'm only killing time. Lucky girl... it's what they tell her she is. Is that how they tell her she should feel? Come with me... We'll be set free We'll walk to Atlantis On the bottom of the sea Lucky girl... walks through the streets Streets of an endless nowhere Lucky girl... she can't look at anyone without being stared at like a stranger. Lucky girl... wraps herself in black Every now and then she thinks about turning back Come with me We'll be set free We'll walk to Atlantis on the bottom of the sea We'll walk right out of this town Leave this world, won't turn around We'll walk right out of the place Won't turn back, won't leave a trace [humming] Come with me We'll be set free W'll walk to Atlantis on the bottom of the sea We'll walk right out of their lives.
