[VINTAGE MUSIC FROM RADIO] [MAN ON RADIO] Good morning, dear listeners across the archipelago or wherever you may be. This is the Radio of the Republic of Indonesia... [MAN] Morning, Dad. I'll put on your friend Mr. Benny's song. ["APATIS" BY BENNY SOEBARJA PLAYING] [WHISTLING] - Galih. Have some breakfast. - Hello, Mom. [MOANS] Your porridge is the best in Bandung.

[BOY 1] A transfer student? - [STUDENT 1] Isn't that Galih? - [STUDENT 2] Yeah! We should interview him for the wall magazine! - Let's go. - Come on! Your notes. Galih. Do you have a minute? - Sure. - We want to interview you. [TENDER PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] - Can you tell us your daily routine? - [BOY CAT-CALLS] - Hey, Girl. - [GALIH] I write poems. - [SCHOOLBOY] What's your name? - [STUDENT 1] Poems and...? [LIGHT-HEARTED MUSIC PLAYING] [SNICKERS] So uptight. - Galih? Your hobbies? - Right. - Singing. - I see. [CHATTERING] Everyone. Attention, please. Meet your new classmate. She transferred from Indramayu. Her name is Ratna... - Suminar. - Ratna Suminar. [WHISTLES] [TEACHER] Hey, Anton. Listen up. Ratna's dad asked me not to let anyone harass this little angel. You may sit with... [ANTON] With me. It's empty. Fatur said he'd move. No. That would be dangerous. She can sit with me. Right. You may sit over there. - Thank you, sir. - Yes. [TEACHER] I'll see you all later. [STUDENTS] Yes, sir. Hi, I'm Erlin. Ratna. You can call me Nana. Hi, Nana. I'm Mimi. Nana. I'm Nurhandoko. You can call me Nurhandoko. [CHUCKLING] [MIMI] Where are you from? Yogyakarta, but my dad had to work in Indramayu for five years. Then we moved here, close to the main office. [MIMI] Oh, I hope you'll like it here in Bandung. [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, Indramayu princess. My name is Anton. Your hand is soft. I believe your heart is much softer. Let her go, Anton. You're being rude. Yeah. Go back to your seat, Anton. What a nuisance. [ANTON] I promise I'll show you around Bandung while enjoying colenak and Cisangkuy yogurt. Don't mind him. He's a bit of a weirdo. [GIGGLING] [SCHOOL BELL DINGS] [STUDENTS CLAMORING] [STUDENT] Galih is so handsome! - He's so good at guitar! - Let's go to the cafeteria. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] DOB: OCT 7, 1967 DREAM JOB: FAMOUS MUSICIAN - Cute, isn't he? - Oh, God. [EXHALES] Mimi. [MIMI CHUCKLES] No one could resist Galih's charm. It seems that includes you. That's not true. Oh, really? Your eyes have been glued to that picture of Galih. [CHUCKLES] No, Mimi. I was looking at this. The school's farewell party art festival. You want to participate? You should join our group. Can I? Of course you can. Okay. [CHUCKLES] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] - This poster, right? - [RATNA CHUCKLES] Yeah. I'm looking at this. Let's begin. [UPBEAT '80S DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Start! - [MUSIC ENDS] - And done. Okay. Let's take a break. - Hot, isn't it? - Yeah. - I need to use the restroom. - Okay.

[STUDENTS CHEERING, CLAPPING] - Nurhandoko. - Yes, ma'am. - Please pass these on to your friends. - Yes, ma'am. [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] You've only been here a week, but many have sent their regards to you. [EXCLAIMS] Who sent them? Sumarsono, Stefanus, Adi Maulana, Eddy D. Iskandar. They said they want to keep in touch with you. [EXCLAIMS, GIGGLES] Just give nothing more and nothing less than your regards back. Your fans are amazing. They're all hot and rich. Their parents are rich, Erlin. Not them. Ratna's heart belongs to another man, Erlin. That would be Galih, yes? - [LAUGHS] - No, Erlin! Mimi! - No? But you're blushing. - [ERLIN CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] Oh, well. You won't have it easy once you fall in love with Galih. Melting his frozen heart will be tough. Erlin is speaking from experience. Come on. That was in the past. I have Nurhandoko now. He is loyal and caring. He is caring, all right. [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] [NURHANDOKO GRUNTS] [IN JAVANESE] My dear, prettiest Erlin. Your orders. This one is for you. - Thanks. - And for you. Dig in. Oh... One for Nana coming up. [NURHANDOKO] Ma'am! [MUSIC ENDS] David. - What is it, Anton? - Got any cash? Sorry, I don't have any. Loser. Get lost. [ENGINE STARTS] [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS] Hi. Hop on. I'll take you home. Thank you. But I prefer to walk. [RATNA] My house isn't far from here. [ANTON] You'll get sweaty. And, your beauty might fade. Sweating is healthy, it's not harmful. What's harmful is speeding on a motorcycle. You may refuse my offer today, but I'll have you know, Anton never gives up. [ENGINE REVS] [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] What happened to your bike? The chain came off. That's unfortunate. I don't need your pity. Galih. Can I borrow your accounting notes? Take them from my bag. Is it okay if I take it myself? Yeah. Which book is it? The book with the brown cover. I'm borrowing it. - [GIGGLES] - What? Sorry, Galih. Your face has oil stains from your hands. You've spread it. May I help you clean it? Use this. [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] I'll do it. Thanks. You can take it with you. Feel free to return it anytime. I have to go. [TENDER MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [DOOR CLOSES] Galih Rakasiwi. "Dear R"? Ratna? [SIGHS] No way. A single smile Blossoms in a flow of emotion What secrets stay quiet in a heartbeat? As you were like a golden gazelle Hopping around in front of me [CHUCKLES] Your warmth I long for [GIGGLES] [AYU] How's school, Na? Has anyone caught your eye yet? Galih Rakasiwi. [LAUGHS] - But it's pointless. - Mm? My dad will get mad. [SIGHS] As if he wasn't a teenager before. Your parents even started dating in high school. Really? Of course. I used to be their scapegoat. Toto asked me to hang out... but he went somewhere else. To Sri's house. [CHUCKLING] Oh, gosh. High school is the best time to experience dating. Going out on a date in your uniform? [EXCLAIMS] That's the most fun. But it could distract me from my studies. You should have distractions when studying so you can concentrate better. When you're studying statistics, it's easier to memorize when your heart is involved. [CHUCKLES] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Besides, who can resist love when it comes? [TEASING] Galih. Stop it!

You have a cat-like tendency. Sneaking around quietly. I'm here to return this. Your notes. Who's Auntie Ayu? My dad's little sister. We live together. She's not married. I didn't ask that much. Oh. Okay. In your opinion. Which one should I play at the upcoming art festival? "Kidung" or "Apatis"? Both are nice. I'm asking you to choose one. I don't know. In life, you have to make a choice. Sometimes you can't have both. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] In that case, I choose neither. Why? I'd prefer you to sing a song you wrote. I can't write songs. In life, you should give it a shot before you decide to say no. [UPBEAT '80S DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, hey. Ratna, focus! Take it from the top. Galih Rakasiwi's charm is out of this world. [SHUSHES] His gaze managed to twist Ratna up in a knot. [LAUGHS] [SCHOOL BELL DINGING] Hurry! Hey, Nana. Nana! Come on. Let me take you home today. I just want to assist you in getting home faster. Sorry, Anton. As I told you before, I prefer walking. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, you can walk home. Sorry, Anton. I have another appointment. With whom? Galih. Sorry, Anton. Sorry I used your name. But thanks for saving me. Why did you turn Anton down? Getting dropped off by a motorcycle is cool. I'd prefer to be dropped off by bicycle. Will you take me home? Best not to, Ratna. You'd be left ashamed. I wouldn't. Take care. - Auntie Ayu. - Yeah? Did Dad leave for work? Your dad went to Garut with your mom. They left at dawn. [SIGHS] I forgot. I'll be late for school. Relax, Ratna. Your prince is waiting out front. Who? Galih? [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] Did you have breakfast? [TENDER MUSIC STOPS] Anton? - What are you doing? - Hi, Ratna. Did you forget? Anton never gives up. Even though you refused my offer to take you home, I figured you wouldn't refuse me if I offered to take you to school. Relax. If you catch me speeding, pinch my ears. And then, kiss my cheek. - Oh, so this is... - No. I'm Anton. Hi, Anton. Your foot. Sorry. I'll get going, Auntie. Be careful, Anton. [ENGINE STARTS] [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] [BRAKES SCREECH] [ENGINE REVS] [ANTON] Wasn't that fun? We'll do this again. [DOWNBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE STARTS] - Morning, Nana. - Morning, Ratna. Let's go. [GYM TEACHER] Don't take this physical education class lightly. Don't forget, mens sana in corpore sano. In a healthy body lies a healthy mind. We are... Hey! Anton! Fatur! You're late! Following the president's orders, we must socialize exercise... - Is Galih skipping class? - ...and exercise society. Why do you ask? Are you worried? [ERLIN] He said he had a headache. He's now resting in Mrs. Minah's stall. [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] [IN SUNDANESE] Galih. I made you sweet hot tea. Thank you. What's up with you? Need a massage? - No, it's okay. I'll just rest. - [STUDENT] Ma'am. Our drinks? Wait a moment. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERING] Psst. Poor Galih, all curled up. Apply this on him. Now, go. Come on. Galih. [TENDER MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Ratna. Use this on your neck. The heat can relieve headaches. Is this yours? Thanks. You're welcome. Well, then. Ratna. Yes? I'll take you home. Yeah. [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ratna. I have to go. [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] We're here. Thank you, Galih. Want to come in and see Auntie Ayu? I'm good. I should head home. Nana. Yes? I'd like to return your handkerchief. Keep it for another day. Your chain might come off again. You're right. Is there something you'd like to tell me? [CAR HORN HONKS] Your parents? I'm going home. Excuse me, Uncle. Auntie. - Who is he? - My classmate. His name is Galih. He accompanied me home. You didn't invite him inside? He was about to leave when you arrived. You still have legs for walking, right? Don't go home with any boys next time. Understand? Don't be a cheap girl. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [TOTO] Educate our daughter well. Getting overjoyed from a bike ride. Let's go inside. [DISTANT CHATTERING] - [GALIH] Anyway, see you. - Later. [HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - Hi, Galih. - Hi, Ratna. I thought he'd be more assertive after taking me home like other guys. You mean like me? Assertive to whom? To you. [NURHANDOKO] Aren't I? Like which guys? You've been in a relationship? Which guys are you talking about? The guys in movies. - [LAUGHS] - David Hasselhoff, Rano Karno. [LAUGHING] Rano Karno? Rano Karno's roles aren't the assertive types. He plays cold-hearted guys like... [GALIH] Hey, guys. [CLEARS THROAT] The teacher asked me to note those who want copies of economics mock exam papers. Anyone interested? I am. Erlin and me too. Don't forget to write Ratna's name. - Because she's the most interested in... - [GRUNTS SOFTLY] - In the economics mock exam. Right? - [SOFT, UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Ratna. Hey. What? Just making sure he wrote it. Okay, then. I'm going back to class. That's it? Galih, wait! Take a seat. What is it? Ratna just reminded me to invite you to my birthday party next week. Right? [ERLIN] Will you come, Galih? [NURHANDOKO] Come on. Okay? I'm sure you're coming, Galih. Yeah, I'm sure you are. [SCHOOL BELL DINGS] The bell's ringing. I have to return to class now. Why did you do that? He'll definitely come. Let's just go back to class. He looked hesitant. - Shut up! - Come on, class! You two should try this. - Here you go. - [TOTO] We moved here four months ago. You still haven't applied for a job? I'll build a business. Perhaps catering. What's a bachelor in food science doing in a catering business? But it'll be very helpful. I'll start a cheap and healthy catering service. I figured there are plenty of other substitutes for rice... It's too late to start now. Dear. Let Ayu try. No one can work efficiently if forced. [DOOR OPENS] [AYU GASPS SOFTLY] Dad, Mom. I'm going to Erlin's birthday party. This late? [AYU] People party at night. During the daytime, it's called group work. - You can't go. - But Erlin is my best friend. I bet you're all going to get drunk. What do you mean? I said no. Go back to studying. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSES] Teenagers nowadays only care about having fun. [UPBEAT '80S MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING, CLAPPING] Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming. Enjoy the food. - Ratna? - Excuse us. - Happy birthday. - Hi, thanks. - Where do I put the present? - Over there. Enjoy the food! [GALIH] Mimi, Erlin. - Galih! - Wow. Happy birthday. [ERLIN] Thanks, Galih. - Your present. - Thanks. I just know I'll love it. Wow. You got her a gift? You might want to check it. - It could be empty. - [LAUGHS] Erlin. This gift is from the three of us. It's bigger than Galih's. [ERLIN] Thanks, Anton and you guys. Come on in. We have plenty of food and drinks. Galih, wait here. Mimi, I'm going home. No, wait. - Don't go home just yet. - What is it? Stay here, Galih. Let's party once in a while! Enjoy! Call her house. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Good evening, Auntie. I'm Erlin. Yes? Auntie. [SAD VOICE] Can Ratna come to my birthday party? She's my best friend, Auntie. My birthday would be meaningless without her. Yes, I understand. Ratna will attend your party. Thank you, Auntie. [HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [IN UNISON] Yes! What did you tell them? Let Ratna go to Erlin's party. Ayu will go with her. As long as they get home no later than 10:00 p.m. Don't worry. I'll make sure Ratna stays away from alcohol and drugs. Good night. I haven't agreed to this. Dear, please. [UPBEAT '80S DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Galih? Nurhandoko, wait here. Galih! Wait! You can't go home yet! - Why not? - Um... I haven't blown out the candles. Stay here until then. - I should go. - But! - All of our friends are here and... - I've partied enough. Look! Nurhandoko is dancing his heart out. [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] Won't you stay, Galih? The first slice of cake is for my beloved Nurhandoko. [CHUCKLES] Who has been faithful and always will be. [GIGGLING] [IN JAVANESE] Thank you, my love. I love you. [CROWD GIGGLES] I'm digging in. And the second slice of cake is for our class's future couple. Galih and Ratna. [CROWD TEASING] But before I give them this cake, I'd like to request a duet. What duet? Recite poetry and play the guitar. [WHISPERS] I can't. You can. Do it for my birthday? You too, Galih. [STRUMS GENTLE TUNE] A single smile Blossoms in a flow of emotion What secrets stay quiet in a heartbeat? As you were like a golden gazelle Hopping around in front of me I was about to seize it but it vanished I hold onto your image From moment to moment Tear your heart open With the blade of passion I reach for it Your silence, lonely Your warmth, I long for This poem was written by Galih Rakasiwi.

No wonder Ayu said your taste in music is old-fashioned. [CHUCKLES] Everything here... is my dad's legacy. I learned a lot here. About music, about language, and about poetic expression. Galih. This is Auntie Ayu's favorite album. How do I go about buying this album? Not a chance, Ratna. I set a high price for it. No one has ever tried to buy this one. I can make a tape for Auntie Ayu. - Is that a promise? - Sure. - [GALIH CHUCKLES] - Okay. Ratna. Have you read this book? [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] I haven't. This is Romo Mangunwijaya's masterpiece.

He didn't make you one? It's mine. - Auntie! I want to listen again! - No can do. [CLOCK TICKS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Galih Rakasiwi. You're two minutes late. My apologies, Ratna. A customer was haggling over my books. What's up, my gazelle? You're all I think about, Galih. I wish I were Roro Mendut, who's not afraid to speak her thoughts. Who's not afraid of anything. Well, Ratna Mendut. Am I worthy of being Pranacitra in your eyes? [CHUCKLING] You are more than perfect in my eyes, Galih. I've been thinking of you all along. But don't be Pranacitra, for he will part ways with Roro Mendut and die at the hand of Tumenggung Wiraguna. I won't, Ratna. We won't suffer that fate. Our love shall grow to be a wonderful love. [TOTO] This is your final warning. Don't you dare go near my daughter again. [HANGS UP PHONE] [TOTO] Didn't I say you couldn't have a boyfriend? [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Galih is kind, Dad. All men are kind when they have ulterior moves. Ask Ayu if you don't believe me. I do this because I care about your future. What kind of future do you mean? You won't even let me enjoy my youth! What do you think enjoying your youth is? Dating? Who taught you that? Huh? If you think that's enjoying youth, you're mistaken. You'll say goodbye to your future. You'll regret it. But I love Galih, Dad. I can't ignore these feelings! Then explain to me. What is love? You can't? That's because you don't understand what love is. You're blinded by desire. I want you to cut ties with that bookstore boy from now on. Tell him to write a statement saying that he will cut off contact with you. Otherwise, you will not go to school there. [SOBBING] [SOBBING] A breakup letter? It's a condition demanded by Nana's dad. Otherwise, she won't be allowed to return to school. How strange. What kind of father compromises his child's education over falling in love? Well, Nana's dad. I had a feeling this would happen. He gave me a warning a while back. Even... before I could express my feelings to Ratna. That was the reason why I avoided Ratna back then. [TOTO] I heard you're close to my daughter. Is that true? We're just friends. I don't care. Stay away from her. I want her to focus on her studies. I can't have her future ruined by this trivial matter. Do you know Ratna Suminar's last name? Sastroatmodjo. Everyone in Yogyakarta recognizes that name. HISTORY OF YOGYAKARTA [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] I will write that statement. I feel sorry for Ratna. The final exams are coming up. She'll be behind in her grades if she keeps missing classes. I agree. A man should be considerate of the girl he loves. But... It's just a letter, right? You won't break up for real, right? - Snacks? - Ayu. My friend's workplace seems to like your catering menu. - Really? - Yes. They're thinking of booking you for their office's event. [LAUGHS] How many orders? Approximately 50 orders. [AYU GASPS] Galih's breakup statement letter for you, Dad. I, GALIH RAKASIWI, DECLARE I WILL BREAK UP WITH RATNA SUMINAR [TOTO] Let's go. Stay strong. Take care. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Galih. Come forward. Solve question number five. And Ratna, solve question number ten. Yes, ma'am. I'm done. That is correct. Well done. Galih, what about you? I can't, ma'am. Galih. You always solve this question. Galih. We need to talk. There's nothing to talk about. That's fine if you have nothing to say. But would you still take me home? I can't. You know that. Galih. I don't want to get you in trouble. Please let go of my hand. [CAR HONKS] If I'd come any later, you'd have gone with that bookstore boy. His name is Galih. Don't worry. Whatever you're afraid of won't happen. Galih is a man of his word. You still like him. You want me to write a statement too? How many pages will be enough to convince you? Get in. It's about to rain.

Erlin told me you were here. We can't be seen together. Nobody will know we're here. Your dad has spies everywhere. He asked everyone at school to keep an eye on us. [MUSIC ENDS] I don't get it. What's wrong with our relationship? My grades didn't drop. Rather, they have improved since we got together. That's not why your dad split us up. What is it then? We're simply too different! So what of it? Opposites attract. Attract? For some people, differences in social status are not attractive. Wealth is relative, Galih. To me, you're more wealthy. You get to be around all the books and music you like. But not to your dad. It upsets him. And? Must we split up over this? I don't want to leave you, Galih. I wrote the statement. That was for my dad! Not for me! Tell me it's only temporary. Tell me we'll be together after we graduate. My dad will change after we graduate! Promise me, Galih. - Promise me. - Enough, Ratna. I will toss this pebble away. My late father once said, "The further the pebble reaches, the more likely the hope will come true." [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] I'll throw it.

After we graduate we'll get back together. Galih? Are you going somewhere? The teacher isn't here yet. Finally, no one in this class can flirt around anymore. What do you mean? Haven't you heard? Galih got reassigned to Class 3 Social 2 at Ratna's dad's request. Galih. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [AYU] Careful, Nana. Your emotions might spill onto my catering food. I don't want to make my clients sad. I'm sorry. [SNICKERS] [EXCLAIMS] I was kidding, Nana! [LAUGHS] I understand how you're feeling. But right now, you should look at it from his point of view. Galih's? Galih accepted whatever came his way. In other words, he yielded to prevail. I don't understand. Your father is using the fact that you're still in school to split the two of you. Galih knows that he can't fight back. But it will be a different story after you both graduate. If you let your sadness make your grades drop, decline, free fall, that's more reason for your dad to believe your relationship can harm your future. [HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I get it now. That's great. [STUTTERS] Hey, Nana. Slow down, will you? [LAUGHS] That's better.

PRIANGGONO LAUGHS] - I heard you're going to UGM as well. That's right. Psychology UGM. - [MRS. PRIANGGONO EXCLAIMING] - [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [MRS. PRIANGGONO] You can stay at our house. [MR. PRIANGGONO] Yeah, we're serious. [MRS. PRIANGGONO] Don't worry, our house is really close to UGM. [GIGGLING] What a match! [GIGGLING] - [SRI] Thank you. - [MRS. PRIANGGONO] Don't mention it. Dad. Mom. I'm going to help Auntie Ayu. Okay. Get changed. - She's so diligent! - Please, dig in. She's so pretty! [MRS. PRIANGGONO] She's so adorable! - What happened? - Nana. - Nana. - Ratna? - It's fine. - [MRS. PRIANGGONO] What should we do? - Gosh, Dear. - Ratna? Hey. Is dance practice happening? Ratna's not here. We've been waiting for her. So, what now? - Let's go to her house. - Yeah, let's go. - Mister! - Mister! Nurhandoko! You should wait here. Are you sure? - Riau Street, sir. - Take care Erlin, Mimi. - Yeah. Thank you. - Stay safe. [KNOCKING] [BOTH] Anyone home? Oh. Erlin. Mimi. - Hello, Auntie. - Hi. Can we see Ratna? Mm... Ratna is not available at the moment. But she told me to pass you a message. She said she's sorry. She won't be able to participate in the art festival. Why not? This show is important for Ratna too. Is it because of Uncle Toto? He doesn't want her to see Galih. Please understand. Okay, Auntie. Mimi, Erlin, wait. Ratna and I made this cake for all of you. Auntie Ayu. You can't do anything to help Ratna? [CAR HONKS] I have to go inside. I have to cook catering orders. Thank you so much, Auntie Ayu. [CAR DOOR SHUTS] Good evening, sir. Yeah. You're so cruel. [MIMI] Erlin. Thank goodness my father is not like you. Sorry about that, sir! I only spoke the truth. No wonder our daughter changed. She hangs out with rude brats. No respect for their elders. [NURHANDOKO] How did it go? So? [MIMI] Ratna worked hard for the show, but her effort meant nothing to her father. I can see why he does that. Nurhandoko. Why are you standing up for him? It's not that I'm defending him, but Ratna and Galih always see each other at practice. They've graduated! - What's he worried about? - Calm down. I want to try Auntie Ayu's cooking. I bet it tastes great. TO GALIH FROM RATNA Huh? What's this? Galih. There's an important letter from Nana. It's top secret. She sealed it tightly. I think it was meant for you alone. But it's been opened? I opened it and read the contents. Erlin told me to! Don't worry about it. We didn't change anything. [RATNA] Dear beloved Galih. I want to see you. I have something to tell you about our future. Meet me at the holed wall behind my house. Galih. - Galih? - Ratna? - Galih. - Ratna. I miss you so much. I miss you too, Galih. Galih. I'm moving to Yogyakarta. They planned this for me. I don't care about Yogyakarta. I can follow you there. They matched me with someone. That's why I'll be moving to Yogya. I'm so sorry, Galih. [TOTO] Ratna. Get inside. Get inside! - Get inside. - Ratna. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing here? You shall not taint my daughter. - Dad, stop. - Didn't I warn you? - Dad, please. - Stay away from her. - Are you disrespecting me? - Dad, stop! Dad, please! Stop it! - Who do you think you are? - [CRIES] Dad, no! You're just a second-hand bookseller. Dad, that's enough! Bastard. Dad, stop! - Come with me. - Let me go! - Get inside! - Let me go! Dad! - Dad... - Sit. Ungrateful child. Hey, what's going on? You have the nerve to defy me? - [SRI] What's going on? - You're selfish, Dad! You have always pushed me to follow each and every one of your ideals! I don't want to attend college in Yogya! I don't want an arranged marriage! All I want is to marry the man I love! That man has no future! - You don't know Galih! - Nana, enough. You want your future to be working at a second-hand bookshop? I do! Because I know I'd be happier in that shop than living in a castle with a man I don't even know! Stop it! That's enough! You raised your voice at me. [SOBBING] You shouldn't yell. What happened? Come here, you ungrateful child. Brother, no! - Move aside! Ayu! - Dear! No! - Move! I'll teach her a lesson! - No! What kind of lesson? Like back then? What back then? Like how you messed up my love life with Togar! Why'd you bring him up? It has nothing to do with your jerk boyfriend. - But it does! - [TOTO] What? - Stop. - No, Sri. I completely understand Nana's love for Galih. It's the same way I felt about Togar. Just because he was a Batak and an activist, - you kept trying to separate us! - I only want the best for you! - What do you want? - Look at Gatot now! He's successful! He's wealthy! And he has many wives! What kind of wealth do you want? What's your definition of the best? Move. - No. Not this time! - Ayu. Move! - Move! - [SCREAMING] No! - Come here! - Mom! Stop it! Cut it out! [HEAVY BREATHING] If you lay a finger on Nana, hit her, I swear to God... I'll never speak to you again for the rest of my life. Enough is enough.

Normally, I'd sell it for 5,000 rupiah. Normally, it'd be 5,000? Then is 4,000 okay? Okay. How about 3,000? Okay. Um... 2,000? Okay. Well, then... 1,000. [MAN IMITATING A GUITAR RIFF] So cheap? So they all sell quickly. But you said it yourself... People who buy your father's most cherished possessions should appreciate their history. - It's meaningless, Mom. - Huh? Meaningless? We always appreciate these items... But no one appreciates us. They mock us instead. Why didn't Dad find a better job? We could have been rich. Why was he satisfied with this shop? With this life? What's the matter with you? Whatever insults you may be facing, don't let them distract you from who you really are. [VOICE TREMBLING] These second-hand items are what got you through high school. These books made you smart. The music around you made you empathetic and caring to others. That's the real legacy your dad left for you. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING] [GALIH EXHALES] Stay strong. I'm sorry, Mom. [VOICE TREMBLING] I'm sorry. It's okay. I know. I understand how you feel. Good day. Galih Rakasiwi. A package for you. - Thanks, Mr. Jono. - No problem. Mr. Jono. Want some coffee? I'm okay. - I have banana fritters. - [LAUGHS] It's okay. I'm still working. No time. [LAUGHS] Galih. That Beatles album, don't sell it to anyone. It's your father's finest collection. It's valuable. Just you wait. I'll buy it. I have to go now. Excuse me. Ma'am, I'm leaving. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING] TO: GALIH RAKASIWI [HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [RATNA] Galih, my love. I hope you still think of me that way too. Don't give up. I believe that you'll be successful in the future. An outstanding singer and musician. Go to the art college of your dreams. No matter what happens, I will always love you. My love may only be a fingernail, but even if you cut it off it will continue to grow. I hope you like my graduation gift. FAREWELL PARTY [UPBEAT '80S DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] We go straight home after the award ceremony. No messing around. - Let's go. - Yeah. [UPBEAT '80S DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] [AYU] Sit here. Sit here.

[CROWD CHEERING, CLAPPING] But this year is a special case. We have two honor students. With his equally high exam scores, congratulations. Galih Rakasiwi. Class 3 Social 2. [CROWD CHEERING, CLAPPING] Come on, go forward. Thank God. Congratulations, Galih and Ratna. You two are indeed the pride of our school. [CROWD CLAPPING] Next up, we'll have a live performance from... Galih, sir. He'll sing. Oh. [GALIH] There was a girl who believed in me. She told me that we can't say anything is impossible before we give it a shot. Our love story may not be complete... but our dreams come true tonight. This is a song I wrote for her.
