[ambient electronic music] [upbeat music] [crickets chirping] It's a beautiful night... -Yeah. -But, sometimes it scares me. You've always made me feel safe in it. Then why does this have to be goodbye? Because you haven't been truthful. You said you were separated when we started this. I can't be involved with a married man. It's not fair to anyone. Look, patrick, I love you. But you have to make a choice. Until then... We have to do what's right. You're pretty tough, you know that? Can I drive you home? Yeah. I'm sorry I lied to you about susan. I just didn't want to lose you. Live and learn, right? [April] I still love you, patrick, I love you too, April. And I want to do right by you. And I promise you-- -[horn honking] -[April gasps] Patrick, look out! -[both screaming] -[tires screeching] [cars crash] [somber instrumental music] -[somber instrumental music] -[medical equipment beeping] [nurse] you must be stella, April's mom? [stella] yes. Your daughter's fine, mrs. Cook. She's under mild sedation for shock, And her left arm is sprained. We'll be keeping her overnight for observation. Can I see her? Just for a minute. She needs her rest. -Thank you. -Mm-hm. [equipment beeping] I'm sorry, sweetheart, but it's your momma's fault. Just don't want me around anymore. I know she can take care of you. She's doing real well so far. But she wants me to leave. I gotta go. [stella gasps] Sweetie, I'm here. Just breathe. Okay, you're gonna be fine. You're in a hospital. Everything's all right. Okay. Okay, is patrick... Is he... He's in icu. It's touch and go right now. Oh my god. This is just a nightmare. It's a nightmare, it's a nightmare. -April, I just-- -get away from me! Baby, please, just-- I said get away from me! [emotional orchestral music] You made dad go away! I never want to see you again! Go away! Get away from me! I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry. [stella breathing heavily] Oh, lisa. Thank god you're here. I came as soon as I heard. What's happening? She's having a panic attack. They started when she was nine years old, After what happened with her father. Did she receive treatment? She's been seeing a therapist off and on, ever since, But it never goes completely away. She still has trigger moments like this. Sometimes she shuts me out. It can be very difficult. April? [April breathing heavily] Hey, kiddo, it's me. Lisa? Just look at me. [lisa inhales] Breathe. That's it. Release. There you go. Good. Okay. Don't worry at all, okay? You're gonna get out of here in the morning, And you're be right back to work. Your mom's already called nurse kathy, And she's going to come stay with you For as long as you need her, okay? Okay. I think kathy could help. Yeah. She always did. Just remember we're all here for you. Your mom... Your mom is here for you. [gentle piano music] Just stay cool. Breathe. Breathe. [monitors beeping] [low somber music] I am so sorry. What are you doing here? I just came to say goodbye. We both almost died, susan. And that makes it okay That you were sleeping with my husband? I want you to know that I ended it. I wasn't going to see him anymore. I don't believe it! I know what I did was wrong, But all I can say now is I'm sorry. She won't stand between us. I am gonna take care of you now. [low ominous instrumental] You can see, this is what they did. It's really bad. Andy told me to apologize for the screw up. The artist had a solid portfolio. He's not sure what went wrong. It's a lot of work, but I can get it done from home. That's what I came in to tell you. I'm getting a few things together And setting up shop at my home office. So, doctor's orders. Will you be back soon? Couple of weeks. My friend, nurse kathy, is staying with me Until I feel better. I'm...Having some trouble. The panic attacks. [delicate orchestral music] I'm sorry. I shouldn't-- Hey... How about a movie night? It's lisa's turn to bring the popcorn. We'll forget about everything and have some fun. I'd like that a lot. You guys are the best friends ever. Well, of course we are. We kind of love the hell outta you too, lady. Well, duty calls. I'll get the rights to the zingers file for your art board. -Okay? -Awesome. Thanks, marie. Sure. [soft piano music] Damn. ♪♪ Take with food and milk. Great. [bell jingling] Hey, do you guys have some milk, maybe a small bottle? Yeah, absolutely. [April] thank you. Oh, hey, you want your change? Keep it as a tip. [cashier] okay, thanks. [anxious instrumental music] [pills rattle] Hey, let me give you a hand with that. Are you okay? I just... I just need to take my medicine. Yeah. Of course. Hey! [April breathing heavily] [April] come on. [breathing slows] [knock on door] [jimmy] hey, you still with us? It's jimmy. My... My name's jimmy. I didn't get your name, but I... I just want you to know that you're not alone. I know that probably doesn't mean much Coming from a complete stranger, But for what it's worth, I'd like to help if I can. [April] April. What? My name's April. It's nice to meet you, April. You feeling any better? A little. Can I get you anything? No. I'm in a weird situation right now. I have these trigger moments and... Someone I really care about's in the hospital, And I'm not handling it too well. I've never freaked out like this in public, So I'm pretty embarrassed. Oh, don't be. You're going through a lot. I get it. Jimmy, what you did back there, that was really nice. The kindness of strangers is rare, these days. Well, I don't think we're strangers anymore. [both chuckle] So... You gonna be okay to drive home? I can totally give you a lift. But my car. Oh, I don't mind coming back and getting it for you. Yeah right. I'm gonna give you my keys and I'll never see you again. Totally. How did you know that I was the world's slickest car thief? I always know these things. [both chuckle] Would you mind terribly if I checked in on you later? Just to make sure that you got home safe and everything. I'm fine. Thanks for offering. But, you know... Here's my card if you wanna call me to chat on the phone. Graphic design. Nice. Thanks again, jimmy. [jimmy sighs] [uneasy instrumental music] -[birds chirping] -[dog barking] [phone ringing] Hey, how's it going? Everything set up? Hi, marie. I'm good. Feeling strong. You know, I do the whole zen thing When I'm in my safe place. I know. April, you know it wasn't your fault, What happened to you and patrick. Tell everyone I miss them. Let mario know that I'll be in the office as soon as I can, And I will slay this fruity monster thing in no time. I'll call lisa about movie night. Can't wait to see you both. -Bye. -Bye. [call ends] Hello, sunshine! You know, kathy, I haven't always been the outdoors type. Mom was always saying, "go get you some sun," But I was always inside drawing. Well, she was right. Fresh air and morning sun are great medicine. How's the arm feeling today? I think it's fine. Good. We'll do physical therapy later on if that's okay. Yeah. And kathy, thanks again for stepping in On such short notice. I owe you one. Of course. [soft orchestral music] [crickets chirping] [jimmy sighs] [low ominous music] Hm. [phone ringing] Um... Hello? Who's this? It's your car thief. Jimmy. [chuckles] [jimmy] how you doing? I'm a little overwhelmed. Well, if there's anything I can get you, I'm glad to help. That's so kind. But I'll have to admit it, It's a little scary having a new friend during all of this. I overstepped, didn't I? No, no, no. You didn't. You're a nice guy, fast with a quip, too, Which I appreciate. But I have a friend, kathy, Who's a nurse, staying with me. She helps me with a lot of my issues. And I don't wanna overwhelm you with my problems. I totally get it, And the last thing I want to do is step on kathy's toes. Thanks, jimmy. That means a lot. It really does. Talk soon, okay? Take care. [anxious instrumental music] [crickets chirping] [stella sighs] [gentle piano music] -[stella v.O.] April, -[keyboard clacking] I know you're hurting, And I want to be there for you. I know you blame me for what happened to your father, For the way he died, But there are things you just don't know. I love you, sweetheart. I want to help you heal. Please get back to me. [stella sighs] [crickets chirping] [low eerie music] Hey guys, I want to send loads of thanks To all of my friends Who have sent me well wishes and flowers. I'm so lucky to have you guys. What happened was a real tragedy, And I can't say that times haven't been hard for me, But I am rising above, as they say. Nurse kathy is amazing, and I'll continue to post. I love you guys, and thanks so much again. Bye. [ominous atmospheric music] [April] what are you doing? Why are you acting this way? April, I love you! Why does this have to be goodbye? Patrick, what's happening? I loved you April! -I'll always love you! -[engine revs] Patrick, slow down! Just me and you against the world now, April! -Don't be afraid. -[engine revs] Patrick, stop the car! -I love you, April! -Patrick! [April screams] [cars crash] [April gasping] [lisa] hey, best friend! Hey, girl! [lisa] how are you? I'm good as long as you brought me my sushi. I don't know how you eat this stuff. It smells like a fishing pier. How would you know? You never even tried it. I've never tried skydiving either, But there's a reason we don't have wings, girl. Valid point. [both laugh] Hey, so how's kathy working out? She's been great. I feel really safe with her there. Good. You should maybe give stella a call. She's worried. I will... Soon. Well, don't wait too long. She's your mom, and she loves you. Oh, god. Listen to me. [both laugh] I sound like somebody's social worker! You sound like somebody's best friend... Best friend. You know... I had an awful dream last night. It felt real. And I think I'm just afraid of losing everyone I care about. And I feel like the situation that happened is my fault And everything is just closing in. Listen to me. It's not your fault. Plus, you know I'm not going anywhere. Come on. Just eat your yucky raw fish. I'm having me some good, old-fashioned rabbit food. Yeah, you have fun with that. [both laugh] [crickets chirping] [nurse kathy] why do you think you keep distancing From your mother? I don't want to, but what happened with my dad... I just can't seem to move past that, you know? He said mom didn't want him there, And a few days later he just kills himself. I locked myself in a room, didn't come out for days, Didn't eat, and hardly slept. And now here you are. Yeah. You've trapped yourself with resentment, April. Do you see that? Yeah, I do. But I want to move past this. I know I have to move past this. I will. [nurse kathy] you're gonna be fine. Yeah. [nurse kathy] I need to go pick up my dinner. I'm famished. [soft ominous music] [jimmy breathing heavily] [low ominous music] [bottle rattling] [suspenseful instrumental music] -[tire iron smacks] -[kathy grunts] [April sighs] [phone line ringing] [police siren wailing] [nurse kathy recording] this is kathy carpenter, r.N. I'm away at the moment. Please leave your message. [voicemail beeps] [April] hey, been gone a long time. Maybe you ate at the restaurant or... Had to run home or something. Please call me so I know what's what. Okay? [April sighs] [anxious string music] [soft orchestral music] [phone ringing] Hey, you. I've got some bad news. Brace yourself, okay? Wait, what's going on? [lisa] the police found nurse kathy in a parking lot. What? They told me it looks like severe Blunt force head trauma. They admitted her to mccabe general last night as a jane doe Because someone stole her id. They had to run a trace through her car registration. If they let me in to see her, Maybe I'll get more information at the hospital. I'm on my way there now. I'd like to be there too. Okay. I'll see you soon. [anxious instrumental music] Can you just let me know as soon as you have a room number? -Lisa! -Okay. -Hey. -Hey. [April] how is she? They say she'll be okay. They took her out of I.C.U. This morning, But she's still not awake. They're not letting anyone in to see her just yet. Well, at least there's some good news, right? Yeah, yeah. I just... I keep thinking about-- Patrick. Yeah. You know, I'm gonna go visit him. [lisa] tread carefully, okay? I will. [delicate instrumental music] [monitor beeping] Hey. I know you probably can't hear me at all. But we never really got a chance to say goodbye. I remember when we first met. I was so in awe of you. I never wanted to hurt you or anyone you cared about. We were so in love. And I guess part of me will always love you, patrick. [April] this... This is goodbye. I have to move on, and so do you. I know you'll get better and double down, And you'll conquer the world, And I will be so happy for you. Take care of susan, okay? She's a good woman. You guys deserve a second chance. And who knows? Maybe I'll even get one too. [tense orchestral music] [phone ringing] Well, hello again. I hope you don't mind me calling back. No, no, not at all. [low ominous music] It has been a rough day though. Oh no. Why? Remember my friend, nurse kathy, who was staying with me? She's in the hospital. Oh, April. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? No. I just have to realize that some things Are just outta my control, you know? I do know. Look, I actually was calling because... I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get lunch sometime. I'm guessing today's sort of off the table, but... No, I'm actually kind of starving. What'd you have in mind? I'm guessing you're a cheeseburger kind of lady. Very perceptive. Perfect. How about we meet at the park off adams? I think I'd like that. Mmm. You know the secret to a good burger? What? It's the veggies. Nice crisp piece of lettuce, fresh tomato, little pickle. Gives it that crunch. Mmm! The things you learned in culinary school. Oh, I didn't know you were in culinary school. [jimmy] mm-hm. That's pretty cool. I know this might sound a little crazy, But I feel really comfortable with you. I did since the first time we met, And I can't really explain it, but... I tend to jump in situations, And sometimes they're worth it, and sometimes not so much. Well, we live and learn. [anxious atmospheric music] Live and learn, right? [jimmy] you okay? Sorry. You reminded me of somebody. He used to say that all the time. "you live and learn." Well, it's a pretty old expression. I'm sure a lot of people use it. God, I'm sorry. I need to move on. [chuckles] It just... It seems so inhuman. They say there's always something there To remind you of them. When I was a kid, my dad used to say, "take it on the chin, sit up straight, And don't let anybody see you cry." He died when I was a kid. It was just me and my brother after that. I'm sorry. [jimmy] don't be. [jimmy] live and learn, right? Live and learn, right? [anxious atmospheric music] [April hyperventilating] You okay? No, no, I don't... Look, I'm sorry. I have to go home! Hey! April! April, come back! [jimmy] April! April! Look out! [horn blares] [April screams] Are you okay? Are you okay? I think so. They didn't even slow down. Some samaritan, huh? [April panting] You saved my life. I feel so dumb. These... Attacks. No, no, no, no. You're okay. You're okay now, all right? Okay. Thank you. You mind following me home? Thank you. I'm sorry, jimmy. You probably think I'm some crazy woman. I don't think that at all. I think you're going through a lot right now, And you are reacting like any normal person would. April, I think you're amazing. Maybe we can try again tomorrow? Of course. I'll make lunch. Real food this time. I'd like that. Great. [uneasy instrumental music] -Hey, April, check this... -[April laughing] April! Put that silly thing down! [stella chuckles] Okay, you know what mommy doesn't like? And that's being on camera. [April] no, you have to tell me! -Mom, you promised, okay? -All right, all right. The things mommy loves most are muffins in the morning, Blue skies in the afternoon, And my favorite season in the whole wide world, which is... April! [stella laughing] Now gimme that camera! Give it to me! Give it to me! You come here! They tell me you're stabilizing. You'll come back to me soon. That makes me so happy. [patrick murmuring] April. [low tense music] [distorted chatter] I am not giving up on you, patrick. I forgive you for all of it. [susan gasps] [nurse] kathy is alert and on her feet, But the doctor wants to keep her a few more days For observation. That's great news. Thank you. They told me kathy's up and about, But they're gonna keep her a few more days. I'm gonna head that way before I go back to work. Okay, well, tell her I'll come by and see her soon. And thanks again for helping me clean this pigs sty of mine. This pig sty... Is gorgeous, and you know it. You are just nervous about lunch. Two days in a row with mr. Interesting. Okay. I guess you know me a little bit. To be honest, I'm a little nervous too. I mean, you met him at a restaurant? How do men and women usually meet? Nothing's perfect, right? I just want you to be careful. Sometimes a guy moves fast, And I wouldn't want to see you get into a weird situation. And I love you for caring so much, -And you're right. -[phone ringing] And that's why I'm playing it. Cool. Okay. It's mom. You should talk to her. Hey. Honey, you picked up. [April] yeah. I heard from lisa about what happened to kathy. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it kind of puts things in perspective. Yeah. I don't know, I guess I've just been In a strange place these days, But I do want us to work through our problems, I really do. Do you think we could maybe see each other soon? You know, face to face? Yeah, let's talk later today. Thank you. I love you. Take care. Love you too. You nailed that! -Yeah? -Yeah. It's your mom. She loves you. All right. [soft anxious music] Hey there. [jimmy] hey! You must be jimmy. I'm lisa. It's nice to meet you. I'd... I'd shake your hand, But I've got kind of a full arm load here. No worries. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon. Yeah. You guys have fun. Thanks. [phone line ringing] [marie] hey. I was gonna call later. April doing okay? She's hanging in, but, hey, I need for you to do me and her a favor. It might sound a little sinister at first. Sinister? I'm all about the sinister. Here's what I need you to do. Oh, nice! You hungry? Of course. I'm always starving. Great. Let's eat. I'll go put these in water. [soft electronic music] [knife chopping] [tense atmospheric music] Jimmy, whatever you're doing in there... It smells amazing. I'll be right there. [jimmy breathing heavily] There we go. And I'll be right back with the drinks. Okay. I cannot wait to try this. [unsettling electronic music] [ice cubes rattling] -Thank you. -There you go. We've got take a selfie. -Okay. -Okay? Ready? Yeah. [camera shutter clicks] There we go. God, this looks good. Well, my instructor tells me I am talented But not a genius. [April chuckles] They wouldn't know genius if they tasted it. This is incredible. -Yeah? -Mm-hm. Well, I'm gonna have a restaurant in a few years. That's the plan anyways. I like the idea of providing sustenance To large groups of people. I guess I've just always been a server, you know? That's very noble, and beautiful. April, can I ask you a question? Of course. I know you lost someone special recently. I'm just-- He's in the hospital, but we're not together anymore. His name's patrick. Do you still love him? I love him enough that I had to let him go. That was the right thing to do. And I'm glad you're here now. But let's just take things slow. We have all the time in the world. Okay. Here. Here's to new friends and new beginnings. [glasses clink] [suspenseful instrumental music] April, wait. [knocking on door] Um... Are you expecting someone? No, not really. I apologize. I will be right back. [low anxious music] [jimmy breathing heavily] [pours out drinks] Hi. Mom. May I come in? I bought us some goodies. I meant on the phone. I guess I thought it'd be better to do so in person. You know, we haven't seen each other at all since... I actually have somebody over right now. But since you're here already, please, come in. [phone ringing] Hey, marie. Well, I just thought I'd let you know I'm doing the deep sinister dive on jimmy conway. Oh, anything weird? No, in fact there's almost nothing at all, No social profiles, no personal info. I found some details from the cooking school he's attending, But that's basically it. My gosh. If April knew that we were checking on him, She would be so mad. Let's just drop this, I guess. He's a nice guy, and we'll just leave it at that. I'll see you soon. Hey, let's get together for lunch. All right, girl. Thank you. [mysterious instrumental music] Why am I still getting a weird feeling about you? I mean, what grad student isn't on social media? [drink pouring] Thank you. Would you like some more tea, stella? No, thank you. By the way, this was so delicious. Oh, good. And these pastries look incredible. Are they from your catering business? Mm-hm. We specialize in desserts. The cooks have always been foodies. It's even in our family name. Well, I guess that skipped a generation with me, Because I can't even boil an egg. You're an artist though. And you've done so well for yourself. This home is beautiful. Thanks, mom. Well, I'll give you two a minute. I got a kitchen to clean anyway. [stella] I probably should have called before I came by. No, I should have called you. [faucet running] I've just been dealing with a lot of feelings lately. I know we've never discussed What happened with your father, And I've allowed that to fester for years. You left us, and he died. And you blame me. I understand. I really do. There's so much you don't know, April. Now is probably not the right time, With you having company and all, But let me just say this one thing. In all my life, You're the only thing that ever mattered, April. I tried to protect you from bad things. I... Protected you too much. I didn't want you to hurt. [April] I promise I wanna work through this. I wanna hear what you have to say, Just when the time's right. Fair enough. But until then, know that I love you, and I'm here to help. Thanks, mom. Well, I hate to eat and run, But I just got a call from the school, So I'm gonna have to run by there. And I think this alone time with you guys is gonna be good. [stella chuckles] Call you later? -Of course. -Okay. It was wonderful meeting you. You too. Charming young man. [April chuckles] [tense atmospheric music] [jimmy breathing heavily] [susan] so what do you think I should do? [jeb] my advice as your attorney is that you sue for divorce. He was having an affair. You'll get damn near everything in the settlement. I don't want a settlement. I want my husband back. Why should I give him to her? Why should she win? Any news on his recovery? He's in an induced coma right now. They're not sure if he'll walk again, but he'll live. Well, that's good. But my advice is that you consider the possibility That he may take up with ms. Cook again. I won't let that happen, mr. Challis. I'm going to do my best to take care of him To bring him back to me. And god willing, we will be happy again. You seem pretty sure about that. I'm hopeful. [ominous instrumental music] [phone ringing] Hey. April, it's great to see you! Everything okay? Yeah. Actually working in nature today. Nice. Actually I do need some help. I need to look at some '80s and '90 cereal box designs. They want that retro kind of look. Do you mind printing the research out On the big color machine at work And bringing it by my place tomorrow? Mm-hm. I'll definitely be back in work soon. I just wanna nail this and get it in tomorrow before then. Sure. I'm on it. Oh, hey. I'm really glad you're coming back. It's not the same without you. Thanks, marie. Bye. Hey you. -[uneasy instrumental music] -jimmy? I thought I might find you here. Stalking me already, huh? I wanted to surprise you. Oh! They're so pretty. Yeah, they reminded me of you. Jimmy, I'm flattered by all of this attention, but-- Oh no. I know, I know, I know. You gotta take it slow. I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you. That means a lot. It really does. Do you wanna go on a walk or something? Actually, I am late for a thing, But what are you doing later tonight? What did you have in mind? There's a new kate scarlett movie streaming. I hear it's really funny. You know, I am overdue for some red wine And some rom-coms. Eight o'clock, your place? I'll take care of the vino. Sounds great. Cool. Thanks again. -See ya. -I'll see you. [tense instrumental music] [marie sighs] Who are you, jimmy conway? [crickets chirping] [ominous piano music] [cologne sprays] [eerie whooshing] [glass clinking] [low ominous music] [both chuckling] Well, that was amazing as always. I think you're going to spoil me. Well, I will defer to you for tonight's movie selection. Okay. As long as you let me pick the wine. Fair enough, but fair warning, I have an unhealthy obsession with low comedy. Perfect. Because my jokes are terrible. [April laughs] Um... I should clean the dishes. [phone ringing] [April] hey. Hold on a sec. [knife scrapes] [ominous instrumental music] [lisa] marie called about movie night. She is totally peeved that you are watching The new kate movie without us. Peeved? [chuckles] [tense pulsating music] How's it going with jimmy? Lisa, are you checking up on me? No! Well, yes. You don't have to worry. Everything's fine. That's good. [April] and I haven't had any panic attacks -In the past few days, so... -[knife tapping] I think everything's getting better. You know, I'm finally feeling the pressure lift away, Like I'm moving forward And leaving all that bad stuff behind. A happy ending. [low ominous music] Have fun, okay? Bye. [gentle music on television] The pinnacle of 1980s cinema. [chuckles] Sure. I am so sorry I made you slog through that. Nah. Hey, it makes you happy. [chuckles] How about some more wine? Indubitably. Okay! [both chuckling] A happy ending. [soft ominous music] [drink pours] [April] I think I'm feeling that last glass. We never know until we've gone too far, right? [both chuckle] Right. [soft tense music] Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm just... I'm thinking about the future. Mm. Oh my. I'm so tired. You'll sleep now. You'll sleep through it all, and you won't feel the thing. I promise. [tense string music] [jimmy's breath shaking] [knife scrapes] [disturbing instrumental music] [knife scrapes] [jimmy panting] [jimmy sobs] -[birds chirping] -[uneasy instrumental music] I'm so embarrassed. I never just pass out like that. I guess my mind and body are just worn out these days. You do not need to keep apologizing. I'm just glad you let me crash on the couch last night. Well, hey, I got a free brunch out of the deal, right? [both laugh] Yep. April... If I told you that I was falling for you, Would that be crazy? We're all a little crazy sometimes. [knocking on door] Oh, that's marie. I'll introduce you guys. She's awesome. [low tense music] Hey, you. [marie] it's so good to see you. The office sucks without the April magic. Anyway, here is the stuff that you wanted, Printed out for your art board just the way you like it. [April] you are a lifesaver. Hi. Hi, jimmy. You're here early. Um, have we met? Lisa told me about you. Oh. All good things I hope? Mm... You got a great review. [jimmy exhales] Yeah, we kind of had a little Impromptu slumber party last night. [marie] hmm. Get your mind outta the gutter. It's not like that. Well, I should hope not. Anyway, here's the stuff that you wanted. -[phone beeping] -I did a pretty deep dive, Looked at a bunch of boxes from the '80s like you wanted. I think this one's actually pretty great. [low ominous music] [April] yeah. Thank you for doing this. [marie] of course. Yeah. Let me know if you need anything else. I can look up a bunch more stuff. Obviously we have a lot of archives, so. Yeah. Uh, you'll have excuse me, girls. I have to run back to the school. I guess I picked up the wrong reapplication forms. I'll see you later? [April] yeah. I have homework anyways. [marie] I'll walk you out. Okay. I'll see you both later. [tense instrumental music] So, how do you like cooking school? You're at the brenton academy, right? Yeah, it's great. How did you know that? Eh, word gets around. And I might have looked you up On a little something called the internet. Uh-huh. [marie] just looking out for my girl, you know? Sure. Forgive me for being nosy. Oh, of course. And I promise she is in good hands. I should hope so. Thank you. [mysterious instrumental music] [phone ringing] Hey, honey. You answered. I think I'll be doing that more often now. You know, I was thinking the other day About how I would follow you around with the camera. It's funny how stuff like that matters so much When you're a kid, and then later it just seems so silly. I think we just change. Growing up just means facing the future. It does, doesn't it? I love you so much April. I love you too, mom. [stella sighs] [mysterious instrumental music] [marie] that sure doesn't look Like a cooking teacher, jimmy. Who the hell are you? Is it done jimmy? I... I don't- Just calm down. Everything's been taken care of. Your lease has been renewed, And we paid your tuition for the next semester. Plus, I deposited the money into your account, What we agreed upon. I am so grateful for both of you. [low tense music] How's he doing? Your brother's going to be fine. Now please answer me. Have you made good on your commitment? Is it done? I had an opportunity, but... Jimmy, what happened? You know I don't like this, susan. There has to be another way. No. No, she has to die. She told me that she didn't wanna see patrick anymore. She said she was moving on. She's lying. I saw her at the hospital. She's still seeing him. And your brother will leave me for her. We can't let that happen. What if we get caught? We won't. But only if you follow the plan to the letter And don't make a single mistake. No one will ever know. Patrick will grieve for her... Then come back to me, and our family will live on. Why can't you just do it yourself? [susan scoffs] You know it has to look a certain way So that neither one of us are implicated. I deleted all of your social media profiles And online references that connect you to our family. And you are his half brother, So you don't have his last name. And that nurse? April's friend? You tried to take her out to make way for me? [tire iron smacks] [disturbing instrumental music] You never said you never said anything about-- Just don't think about that. Think about our future. Jimmy, we love you. We are going to take good care of you. You are going to own a restaurant. I am gonna have children. All you have to do is follow through. [low tense music] What if I take her someplace far away Where you never have to see her again? Wouldn't that get rid of all of our problems? [susan chuckles] What... What are you saying? You haven't started to care for that girl? I'm in love with her. [tense instrumental music] [susan's breath shaking] Please leave. [susan exhales] [jimmy panting] [suspenseful instrumental music] [mysterious instrumental music] [jimmy breathing heavily] [shower running] [mysterious instrumental music] This is crazy. This is so crazy. [susan] hello. [unsettling instrumental music] Hi? What are you doing here? Why are you following jimmy? Was I? You're April cook's girl friend. Marie, is it? How do you know that? People who live online Shouldn't be surprised when someone knows all about them. You're here to spy for her, aren't you? Look, I think there's been -A big misunderstanding. -You know, marie, I should really thank you. I had a setback today, And you are gonna help make all that go away. [low tense music] Now, turn around, go inside quietly. Don't worry. Jimmy doesn't lock the doors. Typical bachelor. Please. Please Just stay calm. Sounds like jimmy's just finishing a shower. He'll be out here shortly. We can all sit down and have a little talk. Look, I don't know what's going on here, But I promise I won't say... [crying] Oh my god. [soft tense music] Oh, marie. -[gun shot] -[marie gasps] [body thuds] [jimmy breathing heavily] What did you do? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, jimmy. Oh my god. She's dead! She knew what was going on. She followed you from my house. She would've told April everything. I had to deal with it. [jimmy] you killed her. Jimmy... I regret all of this. There's been so much collateral damage. But my mother taught me a very important lesson When I was a child. She taught me to stand up for our family. She was strong, but she did it out of love. Listen, I love you, jimmy. I'm going to protect you. Now... Here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to April's house, surprise with flowers, Be charming, keep up appearances. I will take care of everything. What are you gonna do with her? The less you know, the better. Please, jimmy. Please. [soft tense music] [troubled instrumental music] [jimmy breathing heavily] [phone unlocks] [low ominous music] [text message whooshes] [somber instrumental music] [lisa on phone] hey. What's wrong? It's probably nothing. Please tell me. Well, marie just got on a plane And went out of town and didn't even called me. She said it was for like a family thing. I don't know. She's never done anything like this before. Well, how did you know about it if she didn't call? I got all these weird text messages. I don't know. Did she call you? No, but let me see if I can get ahold of her. I'm sure it's fine. I'll see what I can find out, okay? Okay. I'll talk to you later, hon. [knocking on door] Jimmy, what's wrong? [soft instrumental music] Jimmy... Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to-- Don't. Don't be sorry. I think we were both ready to move to the next step. Was that what's been bothering you? April, would it be all right if I stayed the night? I would sleep on the couch. I just want to be close to you, And I wanna make sure that you're safe. -Jimmy, that's sweet but-- -April, please. Okay, but just for tonight. Yeah. I still don't know how I feel about all of this. I totally understand. We've got a lot of time together. How about I get us something to drink? -Okay. Yeah. -Okay. [anxious instrumental music] [monitor beeping] Everything's been taken care of. I went to the girl's house and left her car there. Took her suitcases, got rid of them done by the river. Covered every base. I'm so sorry I had to do all this, But there was no other way. And don't worry. I made sure jimmy will follow through. Wrapped her body in his bedsheets. I wiped away all my fingerprints, Planted his gun next to her, Made sure her phone was disabled. I even put the picture he had of you in her pocket. It'll look like she broke into his house And he caught her stealing it and shot her. You'll see how happy we'll be when April's gone. [phone line ringing] [marie recording] hey, this is the cell phone of marie javins. Please leave a message after the beep. [voicemail beeps] Okay, weird girl. I'm not really sure where you ran off to, And I'm sure your plane has landed by now, So can you please give your officially upset besties a call, Like right now? Okay. [low anxious music] Hey, mom. Hey. Hey. I was just... I'm so glad you came by. Listen, I have to go to work soon, but- It's okay. I actually can't stay long. Jimmy's making us breakfast. He stayed over last night. What? He slept on the couch, mom. [both chuckling] But I think it may be something more someday. And it has me thinking a lot about family and about us. And I haven't been getting good sleep at night. I just... I hear you. Mom... You said that there are some things that I needed to know, Some things that you've been protecting me from. [stella sighs] When your father went away, you blamed me, But I couldn't help what happened to him. He wasn't the man you thought he was. He was-- Mom, please. He was angry, honey. I was very bad. For a long, long time. I never let you see it. I... Had to file a restraining order to keep him from hurting me. And that's when he left us. I'm so sorry I never told you. My god. I had no idea, mom. In my family, when I was growing up, Abuse was simply overlooked. We were told it was part of being raised. When I became a mother, I never let that happen to you. But I let it happen to me. [stella sighs] Baby, there's so much more to tell, But I've never known how to say it until now. And I just... I've made such a massive thing. Now you haven't. [delicate piano music] We're working through things now, And I don't know how I feel about all of this, But I'm listening, and I'm still your daughter. You're still my favorite season in the whole wide world. Oh, baby... I love you. I love you too. [anxious atmospheric music] [phone ringing] Yes, this is susan banister. [nurse becky] this is nurse becky. I have some bad news. Yes? Your husband just passed away. I'm sorry. [susan clears throat] I understand. I'll... Give a few minutes. I'll call you back. Of course. [tense instrumental music] [susan sniffles] Jimmy, I'm back. What? What? [uneasy electronic music] This is insane. They said he was gonna be fine. Well, I guess they were wrong. We must honor your brother. What about marie? What happens when April and lisa start looking for her? The police are gonna be involved. Well, if there's no body, there's no crime. So long as we finish what we started. What's that supposed to mean? Now that patrick is gone, We are obligated more than ever to follow through. But April hasn't done anything, So there's no need to hurt her anymore. She is responsible for all of this, and I want her dead, You'll make that happen, just like we planned, Or marie's body will be found, and when that happens, I made sure all the evidence points right at you. [tense electronic music] You're the one who killed her. That'll be your story, But the police will never believe it. The gun that killed marie is registered in your name, jimmy. How the hell did you-- Never mind how I did it. It's done. Please, don't fight me. I'll do whatever I have to. You're blackmailing me? I love you, jimmy. You're my brother-in-law. We'll always be family. Just do this one thing for me. Please. Kill her! [tense music builds] -[intense drum music] -[jimmy breathing heavily] [crickets chirping] [smacks steering wheel] [banging steering wheel] [jimmy breathing heavily] [text message whooshes] [phone chirps] [jimmy] I can't do what you want. I love her, and so did my brother. I won't hurt her. Oh, jimmy. [intense instrumental music] [phone beeps] [gloomy instrumental music] [frantic knocking on door] Hey, sorry to barge in. I just had to come over. I'm really freaking out. Wait, wait. What's going on? Well... I couldn't reach marie on the phone all day, Which is totally not like her. So I went over to her house and sort of broke in. Okay, just calm down. I'm sure everything's fine. It's not fine at all, April. Her car was there, but her suitcases were gone, And her lucky charm bracelet, It was right there on the dresser. [ominous instrumental music] She'd never get on an airplane without this thing. Never. She wouldn't just leave like that either. I have a very bad feeling about this. Me too. Susan just texted me. Patrick died this morning. Oh my god. [somber instrumental music] I thought they said he was getting better. What happened? [April] I don't know what happened. [vehicle approaches] [jimmy exhales] [knocking on door] You expecting someone? No. I'll get it The worst time to come over. Hello, jimmy, co-- Hey. Hey, where have you been? I needed time. I had so much I had to think about. Patrick's dead. I know. How? April, can I talk to you alone? I think I'm fine standing right here, jimmy! Patrick is my half-brother. What? You must have known who I was back at the restaurant When we first met! Yes. Did you follow me there from work? Yes. So you've been stalking her since day one. It's not like that. It's... It's much, much worse, But I cannot tell you right now, not yet. You're gonna hate me when find it all out, But right now we've got to get out of here, April. We've gotta go to the police, And I will tell them everything. Police? Yes, I will confess. I'll tell them what susan did. I'll tell them what we both did. I'll tell them about marie and kathy. What are you talking about? It's susan. She's out of control now, and she's not gonna stop until- Jimmy. What did she do? What did you do? [phone ringing] [April] not a good time, mom. [footsteps approaching] [lisa gasps] [jimmy] susan, no! Don't do this! [susan] please, hang up the phone. Did I hear you say that was your mom? [April] yes. Is she coming over here? No, no, she's out of town. Play the message she left. Put it on speaker so I can hear. [drops phone and stomps] [suspenseful instrumental music] -[gun shit] -[women screams] Jimmy! Please, don't move, either of you! [women sobbing] Jimmy, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. [jimmy breathing heavily] They made me do it. You both... You both made me do it! [women sobbing] [vehicle approaches] [dog barking] [gate creaks] [knocks on door] Hey. I called, but you didn't answer. I didn't answer because I don't want you to be here! Please don't say that. I thought we were making progress. Well, you thought wrong. I need you to leave. Honey... Please. Mom, you don't understand. What? I mean, I know I failed you in the past, But I'll do whatever I can to make it right. I can't tell you right now. I can't say anything. I just need you to leave. April, please, don't send me away. Okay, we can work all this out. I'm your mother, and I love you. I love you too, mom, but you have to leave. I can't say anything. Please just go. All right. I'm going. But know that I'll never give up on you. Just get out! -April! -[door slams] [low intense music] [April panting] [lisa whimpering] Are you happy now, you monster? I'm not happy at all, April! [gate creaks] I didn't wanna do any of this. But jimmy failed me. I'm sorry, but... You all have to die. April! No! -[gun thwacks] -[body thuds] [stella growls] [susan and stella grunting] [body slams] [women grunting] [gun fires] [body thuds] No, no. Don't. Please, don't. -[susan breathing heavily] -[stella whimpering] [suspenseful instrumental music] -[April shouts] -[vase shatters] [body thuds] April. Oh, baby. [gentle instrumental music] I love you, April. [April] I love you. [jimmy] my dearest April, I cannot begin to express the regret I feel Over what happened that night. But I am happy the darkness has lifted And you and yours are safe now. [jimmy and April] if I could change the past, I would. The next best thing, I guess, is to make amends. We all lose our way sometimes. [just April] we all find ourselves faced With difficult choices. But none of that excuses what I did. I never expect you to forgive me, But please know that, for the sake of you and your mother And everything I almost cost you, I will remain beholden to you, April, For the rest of my life. Jimmy." I don't know whether to hate him or feel sorry for him. He had a few issues. But he can't hurt you anymore. How many is that now? 17 letters. Wow. I should probably just throw them away. It's good that you haven't. You're trying to make sense of it all. Maybe. You saved his life. Ours too. [gentle piano music] You know, the funny thing is I just keep seeing how he looked at me, How I saw patrick and him the whole time And didn't even know it. He would even use patrick's catchphrase, "live and learn". Sometimes we just can't see what's right in front of us, You know, it's too close. Yeah. And I think you really wanted your happy ending. I really wanted that for you too. Who knew, right? [April] yeah. Well, they'll both be in prison a long time For what they did. You're strong. You've already made it, how you've closed the door. We're both free now. [soft orchestral music] [brooding electronic music]
