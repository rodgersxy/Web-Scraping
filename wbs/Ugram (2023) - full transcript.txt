UGRAM [bang] [glass breaking] Police! [woman groaning] [girl screaming] [woman groaning] [girl screaming] [girl screaming] [man groans] Lucky! Lucky! Aparna! Aparna get up! I'm fine. Lucky! Lucky! Aparna! Careful Lucky. After many experiments, Zetro Biotics company discovered... a pill that help cardiac patients recover without any stents. Zetro officials have announced that the pills will be available in the market soon Sir! Which floor do you want to go to? - Second floor. - Where's the attendant pass? The pass? I guess I forgot that in the room upstairs. What's the room number, sir? -202. What's the patient's name, sir? - Aparna and Lucky. Hello? The attendant of patients Lucky and Aparna in 202. He forgot the pass in the room it seems. Should I send him? One minute. There's a patient called Ramesh in room 202. No one was in that room with those names, it seems, sir. What do you mean? Why are they not there? It was just last night that they were treated in the emergency room... and were shifted to room 202. How can they not be there? As I couldn't sleep at midnight, I came down to the lobby to sit. I told you that they are not there, sir. It could be a different block. Try to ask at the reception. Please go, sir. It's been 5 days since we admitted our son in the ICU. You are not showing him to us even once. But you are making us pay the bills. Is he actually fine or did something happen? What's happening in this hospital, sir? Ma'am, your son is fine. He's safe in the ICU. Why can't you show him to us? What's the problem? - Don't panic, ma'am. Why can't you show us once? We came to your hospital for treatment and you treated for 2 days and charged 25,000? All the tests, check ups and bed charges are added up to that amount, sir. If it was a clinic, it would've costed me 2000. To hell with this hospital. Let's go. Yes, sir. Last night at 10:30 I admitted my wife and daughter to the hospital. After the treatment they were shifted to room 202 in this block. Now they say that they aren't here. Tell me the patients' names, sir. - Aparna and Lucky. No one was admitted with those names last night, sir. Lucky, you'll be fine. We are at the hospital. Aparna, don't worry. Lucky will be fine. We are at the hospital. Sir, please wait. They'll shift the baby to the emergency ward and will treat her. In the meanwhile please come and fill the admission form. But you the one who made me fill and sign the form in the emergency ward last night! Sir, I was not on duty last night. I came into charge at 6 am today. What do you mean? You were here last night. I filled out the forms and gave them to you. Wait a minute. If you had admitted them, the filled form should be here. They are not here, sir. Take a look. Why are they not here? Why? Something is happening. Our doctors will treat the baby after shifting her to the emergency room. Doctor. Yes. Doctor, weren't you the one who treated my wife and daughter. Now they say that they are not here. I treated them? When? Last night, sir. I'm just coming from Mumbai. What's the problem actually? The problem? You guys are the one who's creating the problem, not me. Last night I admitted them and you now say that they are not here. Where are my wife and daughter? Where are they? Tell me. Security! - Sir... Help! Tell what you did to my wife and daughter. Where are they? Security! Tell me! Hey! Get back. Please leave him, sir. Hey! Drag him away. Don't come near me. - Please leave him, sir. Hey, hey!

We have to go to the butternut trees for the signal. What the hell? Brother! Someone beat up our guy there! Hey! That guy must've come to our jungle to die. Switch off the lights. Take out the knives. If a new person appears, just kill him. Someone here is beating us after switching the lights on and off. Switch on all our lights. It's the police. Hey!

What do you mean by my wedding? Yes, dear. It's your wedding. Tomorrow evening. What's this, dad! You didn't even tell me. Are you doing everything after telling me? What about my studies? I told you to study in Hyderabad and you are studying on a bullet bike in Warangal well. After you are married, you can go to America... Then study roaming in the car with your husband. Dad! Siva and I have been in love for the past 3 years. You loved him. Now forget him. That police is not right for you. If he has a uniform on his body, he'll act up and mess with influential people. Would they be quiet? They might look for the right time and will insult him in public. They might wait for the chance to kill him. We never know. No Dad, Siva-- -Don't shout and hurt your throat, stop! The mehandi people are here. Go and decorate your hands. Hey! Are the bangle people here? Yes, they are here No, dear. - What?

After marriage done, I will unlock you. Take it positively. Have you called that cop, dear? I knew that you would wait for him to come and take you. So I got his photo. If your life has to be good or if he should be alive, do what I say. Siva, are you cursing me? You must be cursing me hard. Okay, Go on.. After that I'll beep those cuss words Siva, do you know what's the greatness of our police station? All the fraudsters stay here. And we stay here, too. Look here. Do I not look like a fraud?

I already told you that I'd be the same on the day that's not mine. It's a good brand. If you want to, smoke it. I promised my wife that I'd stop smoking after marriage. Hello? This is Dr.Sunitha, the chief doctor speaking from Manasa Hospital. Could you please get your SI on the line, sir? Please stay on hold, ma'am. Sir, my dad went missing last night. Since we were going to Shirdi, he wanted some cash so went to the ATM to withdraw. He didn't return until 11 pm. Ma'am, could you call us back in a couple of minutes? SI sir is busy with an urgent case. This is more urgent than that. I'll wait. Please give him. Okay, ma'am. I searched all the ATMs in my area, sir. I couldn't find him. It's him, sir. Reddy! - Yes, sir. You write down. - Please be calm. We are responsible to get your dad back to you. Sir. Fax this photo to all the stations. Okay, sir. Please give your details and register the FIR. Okay, sir. - Thank you. Come on. Sir, Manasa Hospital's doctor is on line. Hello? SI sir Dementia? What's that? Dementia means feeling something which doesn't exist. Since his head was heavily injured the blood was clot in his nerves. Since there's no proper blood pumping his nose and ears are bleeding. And hence he fell unconscious. When there's a severe head injury or if they undergo severe shock, people start to imagine things after going into dementia. In his case now, since he had a bad head injury he went into dementia... and is imagining that he admitted his wife and daughter to the hospital. But in reality he didn't do that. So is his condition serious? Yes. It is serious. But his life is not in danger. We gave him laser treatment. We need to give cognitive therapy for another four sessions. We don't know how he will react to that. If everything goes well he'll come out of dementia. Where? Where are my daughter and my granddaughter? Who are you? I'm Aparna's father. In which room are my daughter and granddaughter? Your constable said that they were at the hospital when I went home. What happened to them? Sir met with an accident. An accident? What about my daughter and granddaughter? Sir came to the hospital alone. They are not here. What do you mean? Last night my daughter called and told me that she's starting to warangal with him. If he met with an accident, they both are also supposed to be there. Where are they? Siva sir started to warangal with his family? Yes! Because of him I was separated from my daughter. After so many days she called me crying... ...and told me that she can't stay with him and that she wants to come to us. I told her that I'd pick her up. She said no and told me that she'd come with the baby. Later when I called she said that he's going to drop them. And later when no matter how many times I called, the phone was switched off. That means he did something in the meantime. I know how happily Sir lives with his family. When he's lying unconscious there what are you saying? Unconscious? He's staging a play. Give him a beating and wake him. Sir, please. You are talking too much about a sincere officer. Please stop. You are all the same. If something happens to them both, I'll not leave him. In this matter I'll go to any extent. You can go anywhere. Wherever you go, the one who'll investigate is the police. So please let us investigate. Whatever you say, I know what to do with him. I came. Hey, Lucky! Come one. Mom! My little princess. Did the police come? He didn't. As usual. Did you call him? I called him twice. He didn't answer. As usual, right? You need to call the right person. Hi, Lucky! Did you come from school? Hey, don't divert the topic, uncle. Go and give the phone to our police. Have you prepared all the evidence to produce in the court? Done sir. Your Police is a little busy, dear. Did he ask you to tell us that or is he really busy? He's really busy my dear. Then switch on the speaker phone and give it to my Police. Present him in court in time, okay? Sir. - Yes? Lucky called. Mister Police, come home fast. Bring me ice cream when you come. I'll bring it. Okay. You freshen up and do your homework. Okay Police. Come home fast. [On TV] Hey, Bhagi... Wife Bhagyalaxmi [On TV] Bring the belt. [On TV] You are wearing the belt. [On TV] Then bring the gun. [On TV] Check it out once, it's right next to you. Sorry, Aparna. I was a bit late. Ice cream for Lucky. She went to bed long back. Did she eat anything? She ate a little and slept. You? Not yet. I told you not to wait and eat at the right time, Aparna. At least give us time to eat with you, sir. Wow! Cucumber dal is great! No one can beat you in cooking. That's mango dal. Lucky told you to bring ice cream. Not me. You learnt how to butter people Mr.Police. Whatever you cook will taste good. It's true. A little more. You eat. Our daughter went missing, sir. - Which area? Balaji Basthi, sir. - Good morning, sir. Morning. - Good morning, sir. Greetings, sir. What's wrong? - Missing case, sir. Since when is she missing? - Since yesterday, sir. She's studying 10th standard in Adarshavidyalam. What's her name? - Varsha. She used to come home everyday, sir. She used to go for tuition from 7-9pm, sir. Last night she didn't come home until 10 pm sir. I called the tuition teacher and asked. He said that she left at 9 pm. Scan the photos and send them to all the stations. Okay, sir. We'll take the responsibility to bring your daughter wherever she is. Do you not have the responsibility to find out if a girl went home safely or not? Sorry, sir. Since when are you tutoring her? - Since her 6th standard, sir. Does she have any relationships? Nothing of that sort, sir. She's a good girl. She only concentrates on studies, I've never seen her engaging in such activities Reddy. - Sir. Collect his call data, too. - Okay, sir. What's the number? Tell me. Sir, a girl tried to commit suicide in Sarurnagar lake. Our rescue team has saved her, sir. They admitted the girl to the area's government hospital. Now she's out of danger. We made her vomit all the water she swallowed. We injected the saline as she's weak. Can I talk to her? - Sure, go ahead. Who are you, dear? Why did you wanted to die? I'm hungry, brother. I ate nothing since the past 4 days. Give me some food. Drink it. My name is Divya, brother. I'm from Jedcharla. I'm studying in the government's Gurukul school and I am staying in a hostel. There'll be a gate between our hostel and our mess. Only one person can enter that gate at a time. Four goons are smoking weed there... They are touching us inappropriately, brother. I was frightened because of them. So I went directly to the room without having food. They are harassing us everyday by having cooperation from the warden, brother. So many girls are frightened like me, brother. I wanted to tell this to my parents... But was afraid that they'd take me home and not let me study. I don't know what to do, so that's why I jumped into the lake. You dare to touch girls? You dare to touch them? Sir! It's because they can do nothing, right? It's because they'll tell no one, right? Hey! Open the doors... he'll kill us. Open the doors. Hey! Open the doors. He'll kill us. Please! Sir! Please, sir. Leave me sir. You dare to torcher the girls who are studying away from their parents? You dare to tease girls? You'll not even let girls have food? You dare to abuse girls? Did you think that no one would question you? You'll touch girls as you wish under influence? You want kick? I'll give you all four the kick you want. Bhanu! Stinging nettle is ready, sir. No! No! Don't. Don't. Don't. Sir, please don't. Don't. Don't. Sir, please don't. No! No! Don't. Don't. Don't. Sir, It's burning, sir. Ouch, it's burning. It's burning. It's burning, sir. It's burning, sir. Sir, please..It's burning. It's burning It's burning, sir. It's burning, sir. You guys were horny... is that enough now? Did you find the kick? Don't, sir. Tell me. Did you find the kick? It's burning. It's burning. It's burning. It's him, sir. He's the warden. Parents send their girls trusting you but instead of taking care like a brother -You entertain them and drink with them? -Sir, please sir... I won't repeat this. Leave me sir... Four boys named Gani, Mahipal, Ganja sai and Gangadhar were arrested... for abusing girls in the Govt. Gurukul Hostel under the influence of ganja. The court remanded them to jail for 14 days along with the warden who helped them 14 DAYS LATER Hi, sir how is your vacation going? Everything is fine Victor, tell me. I got an important message from the commissioner. Well the day after tomorrow... The commissioner has called a meeting with all the Cls and Sls in his jurisdiction. We got instructions that we must attend it. What about you? Okay, We are started. Okay, sir. Aparna! We are leaving Hyderabad. It's your birthday the day after tomorrow. We came this far to celebrate it. Also you have a ten days leave. If they ask you to cancel the vocation and join immediately.. how did you agree? Cops and military will be called up for duty according to the emergency, Aparna. Is duty important for you? Not family? Try to understand me once. Please, we should go. I was the one who is understanding from the past five years. You should understand us this time. Aparna, please. Enough. Your mom is still angry? - Why would she be angry, Police? You both mother and child are so great. Look, police, you should come home by 5:30.p.m today. Sure, dear. One minute. - Hey, wait! Lucky! It's the Police's birthday. Let's surprise him. Take this. Put my shoes on now. What secrets do you both have? Won't you tell me? We both are girls. Why should we tell you our secrets? Look! If you don't be home by 5:30 pm I'll come, dear. I should be home by 5:30 in the evening, right? Okay, bye, Police. - Bye. Aparna. Are you still angry that I brought you home when we're in the middle of the trip? You plan it this time. I'll not even bring my phone. There wouldn't be any disturbance. Even then you want to bring us back for your duty? Aparna, please. I'll come home by 5:30 in the evening. Bye. Who's that? Hey! Who are you all? You came directly into the house! Despite the installation of CCTV cameras, crimes are taking place. Those who do not install CCTVs should be given a stern warning. No! This will go into your throat if you speak. Why would your husband care about the girls we screw? He dares to send us to jail for 14 days? I'll show him. I'll show him who I am. PM Sir will visit the city for two days in the first week of next month. Look. Look, I'll kill you if you don't Take a look! Open your eyes. If he mess with us another time, we'll have to mess with you! Tell that to your husband. Ma'am, your daughter is here. Take her. Hey, balloons! You decorated the balloons well, mom. Police didn't come home at the right time today, either. I think it is as usual. I already told Police several times to come home by 5:30. Fine, I'll go and get changed. I'm sorry, Aparna. I came late because of the meeting with the commissioner. I'll be back ready in five minutes. Wake up Lucky in the meanwhile. Okay? I'll come. Aparna. You are still like that? - Lucky, dear, get up. Let's cut the cake. - Aparna, where did you keep the cake? Is it in the fridge? Aparna, after we cut the cake, let's go out for dinner. Get up, Aparna. I'm sorry, Aparna. Get up. Are you crazy? Are you crazy? How many times should I call you? Hey! I couldn't answer the phone 'cause I was busy in the meeting. I called you so many times. Would you not think about the reason? Are you the only police in the nation? Don't you think about the condition of the people on the other side? Aparna, why are you crying actually? What happened? You dare to come and ask what happened after everything is over? Until now no woman ever had undergone the humiliation I went through! Scou***els! They dare to come to my house and abuse my wife? They dare to touch my family? Sco***rels! Where are you going, Siva? An hour... Just wait for an hour. Those scou***rels dare to come to my home? Siva! Hey! Who's that? Hey, stop it. What we have shown to your wife, is it not enough? Shall I show it to you, too? Come on, you...! Come on! Scou***els! You dare to come to my house and abuse my wife? How dare you send us to jail? Kill him.. don't leave him. You... Hey, I'll kill you. Mom, Police. Aparna. Where are you going with Lucky? I'm going to my father. What do you mean by that? I just now killed those 4 scoundrels and came back. They are dead now. Shoot us both with the same gun. There wouldn't be any person who would question and wait for you. Aparna, why do you talk like that? Come on, let's go home. When you held my hand before my father, I thought you'd stand for me lifelong. But I didn't imagine that you'd make me a loner and stand on the road like this. Even though I humiliated my father in public for you, when I called him after 5 years, he was worried and said he'll come to pick me and Lucky. I told him that I'll come by myself and he called me 4 times in this one hour. To check if I started or not. That's what I call love. I beg you! Please leave me and my daughter. How would you go at this hour? - I'll catch something and leave. If I don't get any, I'll just walk there by foot. But I'll not stay with you. Come here, Police. Mom said that you wouldn't be staying with us from tomorrow. Father is not there if you are not, dear. Aparna. Listen to me once for the baby. I'll drop you in Warangal. Mom, the phone is ringing. Hand me the phone - Take it. We will go to the hospital in 5 minutes. Come on.. fast Nothing will happen to you. Don't cry Lucky. Nothing will happen to you. We are near the hospital. Since he had a very bad head injury, he was in dementia's effect and was imagining non-existing things. Even though he didn't bring his wife and daughter to the hospital, he's in the imagination that he brought them. There's no public access to that road yet. His wife and his kid went missing in that spot, right? Right? - Yes, sir. The encounter that has happened and the brawl that happened at the bus stop... Do you think there's a relation between them? There is, sir. Look here. He is Gajendra alias Gani. He is the main person among the four. He's Ganja Sai. Mahipal and Gangadhar. Mr.Siva has arrested them all in the hostel girls' abusing case. They came out on bail after fourteen days. And they must've gone straight to his house and abused his wife, sir. Siva sir who came home might've got to know about the matter from his wife... and he started on a bullet with the gun. Exactly after ten minutes Aparna madam went out with the her daughter. Siva sir used his service revolver to kill those four. After that, Shiva sir left for Warangal in a car along with his wife and daughter. We've recovered those three dead bodies on the day sir. But the fourth person is Gani. He escaped from Shiva Sir's encounter. Sir, that Gani must've followed Siva sir to the accident spot and when Siva sir was unconscious, he must've kidnapped his wife and his kid. Madam and her daughter are definitely with him. If we find him, we'll definitely find them, too. Oh! my god. Sruthi! - Madam! Come fast. My goodness. What is this? Mr.Siva, you are under treatment. You shouldn't take these off -Are Aparna and Lucky hurt? -First come and sit down. I'll tell you. What happened to them both? Where are they? I need to go and see them now! Mr.Siva, be calm. Don't take stress. Police are searching for them. They'll find them soon. Searching them? What happened to them? They both went missing on the day you met with an accident. But please trust me. They both will come to you soon. They went missing? How long has it been since my accident? Eight days. You had a huge surgery. You just gained consciousness. You should not get tense! Aparna and Lucky are missing since 8 days? -Please listen to me. Please listen to me. Mr.Siva! Mr.Siva! Mr.Siva! Sir, please wait... where are you going? Reddy! Aparna and Lucky are missing, it seems. I need to search for them immediately. Sir, please wait sir... Hello? - Yes, Reddy. Siva sir regained consciousness and is going out of the hospital, sir. Hey! what are you doing? Go and catch him. Sir, Gani is here. What? Gani is in the hospital? Catch him. Catch him first. Sir, If he's chasing Mr Siva, that means he's going against death. Only if we catch that Gani alive, we can find where Ms.Aparna and Lucky are. Okay. Move. Sir, Siva is going to the accident spot Accident spot? Are you still alive, you sco***rel? I'll not die until I kill you, you...! Then come on to me, you sco**rel! Sir, they both are fighting each other Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! I'm in a five kilometre radius. I'm coming. Okay? Sir! Why did you kill him? Aparna madam and Lucky are with him. We have been trying to catch him for the past 8 days. You killed the one and only evidence! Sir... Victor... - Sir.. The commissioner is very serious in Siva's matter. Follow the procedure, register an FIR and surrender him in the court tomorrow. Court? Your honour! Did the law give him a special right to kill the people who are accused in a case? What message will these law abiding cops give to the society... when they are becoming rowdies and committing murders? In my opinion when the criminals are out of control... I think it's not wrong for the police to lose their balance. When Sivakumar was going to Warangal with his family, he met with a severe accident. If you give permission to Ms.Sunita, the doctor who treated him, she will now explain his condition to the court. Permission granted. Good morning, sir. After the accident, blood was clot in his head and he went into dementia. He gained consciousness after eight days. There's no chance he can get fully better without getting treatment for two weeks. In the meanwhile if he takes mental pressure saying police, custody and jail, there's a danger that he'll go into dementia again. If that happens, we'll be the reason behind it. So, I request the court to sanction two more weeks of time for treatment purpose. According to the Supreme court's guidelines, section 167 of CrPC... if any accused is suffering with old age problems, or if they are suffering with any illnesses, if the court wants to put them on remand, they should put those people under house arrest. Taking this judgement and my client's condition into consideration, I kindly request the court to put him under house arrest... and to let him be under doctor's observation and treatment. The court orders the local police to make sure that... Sivakumar takes treatment from his doctor under house arrest... and appears in the court after 14 days. If the police or Sivakumar defy this order the court will take serious action on them Thank you, doctor. Even though you don't know me, you appointed a lawyer for me and stopped me from going to jail. That's my responsibility. Also why wouldn't I know you, sir? In the Gurukul hostel's abuse case, you not only saved Divya and the 300 girls staying there. You saved the assurance that... ...people can approach the police station if any girl faces a problem. You saved the trust that a cop will stand for you... ...to protect you more than a brother whom you tie rakhi to. To perserve goodness in these times, people like you should exist Mr.Siva. Anyway, she is Sruthi. Our junior doctor. She'll take care of your medications for two weeks. But please don't take any stress. Okay Doctor. I'm really sorry sir. I didn't even imagine that a situation like this would come, sir. You did your duty, Victor. What's the use if Idid my duty, sir? We couldn't save the suspect. You killed Gani unnecessarily, sir. If he's alive, Ms.Aparna and Lucky would've been home by this time. Victor, do you believe that he took Aparna and Lucky? If he followed me on the day of the accident, he would've seen me alive there and killed me. If that didn't happen, it means he is not there. How did you leave that little logic, Victor? Like all the missing cases, this happened randomly. Will you help me, Victor? Sure, sir. Tell me. Along with the missing cases registered in our station, could you please get me the details of all the missing cases in our city? If we study them, we might get a clue. Okay, sir. I'll send you. Okay Victor. My mother-in-law has been missing for two days, sir. Yesterday night she went to Lord Shiva Temple in Hayathnagar, sir. But she didn't return, sir. I wonder where she is. Please search for her, sir. My son went missing for 2 weeks, sir. He's working in a rice mill in Moinabad, sir. [indistinct Voices] Another missing case has been registered under Charminar police station. The missing cases posing a challenge for the police Department. Due to lack of clues, the investigation is progressing sluggishly. My father went missing sir. My mother went missing sir. Please save us somehow sir My brother went missing sir. Please save sir. Sir, My father... My one and only daughter went missing sir. What are you doing? We worked hard to get a house arrest order to make sure the patient rests. If you are stressed by investigation, he'd have a blood clot again. Sorry, ma'am. I'll make sure that this never repeats. Sir, please try to understand your health condition. To investigate this case, there's not only your police station. There's the whole police department. You are upset that you couldn't find your wife and daughter. But if you go around saying that you'll investigate and stress out, even if the police find your family, you'll go into a stage where you can't recognise them. So please don't take any stress. Okay doctor. Sruthi. Please come with me. Okay Madam. Need to start the new medication. What is all this, sir? If that happens to you, I wouldn't have given you the hard disk. At least, from now on, follow the doctor's precautions. Please, sir. Sir, if you do this again... Victor, listen to me. According to the information we have... approximately 400 people went missing in our city in the last six months. Our department solved 50% of the cases. Few of them committed suicide on the railway tracks and the lodges and some people drowned themselves in the lakes in the city limits. And another 10 people were murdered. All these people add up to 40. So, it is 10 %. The remaining 40% of the people that are still missing, my wife and baby are there. All these people were not missed. They were abducted. Searching all these cases, I found a common point. All the unsolved missing cases happened in the areas where there are no CCTV cameras. If we re-investigate all these cases, we might get a clue, Victor. Sir! Since they didn't find any, they were left as unsolved cases. We may not find any clues in the old cases. But my wife and baby were kidnapped recently. If we go to the place where I met the accident, we might definitely find a clue. Come on, let's go. Sir! Going out? You already have 4 murder cases on you. If you go out now, it will be contempt of court. If that happens, you can't even sit in the house and investigate. I can't take that risk. I am sorry, sir. Try to understand me, Victor. - Please, sir. Take a rest. Sir! Give these medicines to Mr. Shiva Ok ma'am - I will come tomorrow Sir! Sir! Where is he? Sir! Sir! What happened, reddy? I am charging the phone sir. Sir, the junior doctor gave you the medicines. Thanks Reddy. Hello police, we planned a surprise for your birthday. If you have to know it, you should go to catch the clue in this paper. Oh dear Police! You did well! You are super, police. Open the gift quickly. Open the gift. Happy Birthday to you. - Happy Birthday to you. Hey, police! Mom, come here. On our Police's birthday, let's gift this police doll to our Police. Okay? - Okay. I'm on vacation with my family. Are you still on the phone? Meet Victor at the station if you need anything. Yeah... - Mister Police. What? You'll be on the phone even after you come to the vacation? Hey! Lucky stop there. Lucky! "Oh beautiful, let's enjoy crazily." "Let's give a break to the tension." "Let's chill with a beer in public under the umbrella's shadow." "We are not on duty anyway." "With these little joys..." "let's pass our time like this." "Dubi dubi diba... Long drive." "...Camp fire." "... Feel the high." "Cloud nine." "Entertain." "That's fine." Oh! Put these three fingers like this. Now move these fingers. Not like that. Like this. Oh no, police. Don't you know this? Use your brain, Police. Our Police is a super police. Thank you, Lucky. "Let your eyes show the happiness in your heart." "Let the love symphony ring in joy!" "Let the sound of the shore fill your steps." "Let the rainbow swing on your palm and fingers." "Let's go and get Alladin's lamp no matter in which corner it is." "Let's be on a mission to enjoy everything we haven't yet." "Let's love like this everyday and exchange our happinesses." "Let's make every second of life a festival." "Oh beautiful, let's enjoy crazily." "Let's give a break to the tension." "Let's chill with a beer in public under the umbrella's shadow." "We are not on duty anyway." "With these little joys..." "let's pass our time like this." "Dubi dubi diba... Long drive." "...Camp fire." "... Feel the high." "Cloud nine." "Entertain." "That's fine." Aparna! We are going back to Hyderabad. What? Your mom is still angry at me? Next time, you plan it. I'll not even bring my phone. Where are you going, Siva? Those scoundrels dared to come to my home? Reddy, I need to go urgently, get the vehicle ready. What is this? Please go inside, sir. Listen to me, Reddy. I need to go to the accident spot immediately. Start the vehicle. Please listen to me sir... There's no time to explain. I'll take care of things. - No sir! - Start the vehicle! [siren wailing] Why did you come breaking the court rules, sir? You've asked me for clues, Victor. Here are the clues. These white bangle pieces belong to Aparna. I found some in my house and some at the accident spot too I found these red bangle pieces in the accident spot. If we feel that other women are also kidnapped just like Aparna and Lucky. But there's no chance for it. That's because that road is not open to the public. In the missing cases of 40 year old Manikyarao at the Jeedimetla station and 32 year old Annapurnamma at Bachupally station, they found such bangles. They just wrote them as clues. But no one started to inquire about them. No one focused on them. If these red bangle pieces are found there, that means some ladies are definitely behind this kidnap. If we send this tooth to the forensic lab for testing, we have a chance to get some information. Victor, we are just writing down the number of people who went missing. But we are not caring about the people who are still missing. Shall we follow the rules and keep counting? Or shall we break them and save people? Let's save them, sir! Let's keep all these courts and rules aside for a while. Where should we go? Tell me whom we should inquire, sir? Let's solve this case at any cost. I wore this uniform not only to follow the rules, sir. To save people's lives, too. Anil... - Sir... send this to the forensic lab. We need to know if it belongs to a male or a female. Sure, sir. - Go. Let's go sir. Hey police.. what are you doing here? My heart is heavy with worry for her. Did you kidnap them? Tell me, did you kidnap them? We didn't, sir. Hey, get out. I swear on god. We didn't do it, sir. If I get to know that, you are behind all these kidnaps, I swear to god, I'll just shoot you at Charminar. Sister, uncles are here. - What do you mean by uncles? Hey, brother! Why are you here? What did you do to them? What are you talking about? Leave, I'll break your bones, idiot! Hey, brother. I have refrained from doing those bad things for a long time now. All our guys are settled in real estate. We are no way related to this. I know how it feels if our family goes missing, brother. Good, you have a lot of improvement, Mr.Siva. If you take medication like this without taking any stress, you'll get better soon. Sure, doctor. Victor. The doctor is gone, come on. What happened, sir? Your daughter has not come to school for the past two weeks. When we called Ms.Aparna, her phone was turned off. She's not replying to the messages on the school group. Exams will be held soon. When are the exams, ma'am? - In ten days. Sir! Why are you going away, when I'm asking you? Sir! Will Lucky come? Tell us if she'll write her exams. I don't know where they are. I don't know how they are. How could we say them when they'll come? Lucky will write her exams. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir, I need to buy a books for my son. I'll come in two minutes. Let's hurry up... It's getting late. Hey, we only got two people today Let's go to recce early in the morning. Let's try many people, let's go He may be around 40 years old. Because he is a chain smoker... he has nicotine coating all over his tooth. This guy is also a fake trans woman. The tooth we found in the clues belong to him. Earlier he was shocked to see me in the pan shop and tried to escape. He died before we could catch him. These are real trans women. To survive, they roam in autos and visit shops and beg at the signals. And they live in that same poverty. These are fake trans women. They disguise like real trans women and they don't beg. They are leading a luxurious life with cars, bungalows and gold. If they are leading luxurious life without begging, They are definitely behind these kidnappings. I have three pieces of evidence to suspect that these fake people. First one, The red bangles which we found in the accident spot. Second one, This guy's tooth we found in the same spot. The third one... he ran away in fear when he saw me So, he was the one who kidnapped Aparna and Lucky. Who are you? Hey why are you taking her? Lucky! Leave her. Siva! Siva! Siva get up. Hey, leave... According to LGBT and other organisations there are 40,000 third gender people. But in our government's census, there are only 10,000 third gender people. So it says that all the remaining 30,000 people are fake. Sir, then, how should we catch the fake trans women who are behind this crime? Let's throw a bait. A bait? Whom, sir? - I'll be the bait, sir. I'll be the bait, sir. Why do you need that? You are a kid. If something happens to you, what about your family? I was supposed to go to jail and take punishment for something I've never done. You saved me and made me start this tea stall. Let me do this small help, sir. Also if something happens to me, you are there to save! Victor. - Sir. Get this guy from my team and Devi from your team ready for the Recce. As soon as the crime opens its eyes in the dark, let's close it. Auto has entered. Hold it. Take it. Go boys! Go, go. Tell me.. Brother, police are following you Hey! Stop the vehicle... What? Hey! Don't come at us! Scoundrels! Do you hear me? Stop there! I'll kill her! Get back! Get back! Get back! I'll kill her. Put the gun down. Put it down. Put it down. Get back. Hey! Escape guys! Mr Murthy, take Devi to the hospital. Come on. Hey! Come on. Hey, go that way. Hey! Come on... move Hey stop. Victor! - Sir I got the scoundrels! We are the reason for all the kidnappings happening in the city How many people are in your gang? We have a total of 10 teams. Whom are you working for? Why are you doing all these? Sir! We really don't know. There's a team superior to us, sir. We never saw them until now, sir. Team leaders will get a message about how many people we should kidnap. Every day they message us where to keep the people we kidnapped in the city. We make them unconscious and put them in bags... we will put those bags in the places they say. After they collect the bags, they'll message the team leaders about the place where they kept the money. After that, that sim won't even work, sir. Did you kidnap them? No, sir. We didn't do it. Do you know who is he? He's a team leader like us, sir. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... You'll kidnap and sell humans for money? Abducting people could be a small task for you all. But, those who are abducted... have a life When you all are doing these filthy things disguising like trans women, the real trans women are getting blamed for it. Do you know who trans women are? They are the embodiment of Ardhanarishvara. You kidnap people pretending to be them? They are treated miserably in this society. Lately they are coming out as doctors, lawyers and police. And they are trying to lead respectable lives in this society. Because of people like you, people are disrespecting them. Tell me where to put that bag today? Speak out! - Sir.. sir... Sir at the old shed in Gachibowli. Victor, should information about these fakes being nabbed should not get out. If information is leaked, this network will be alerted. Sir... We don't know how many people are in this network and who's behind all this. We only found a link, sir. So better we should inform the commissioner and take their support. Victor, it takes a long time to get a permission to penetrate their network. Today, the place where the bag should be placed is already decided. If the bag is not there now, the whole operation will get wasted. So, I'll go in that bag. Okay sir. Mr.Siva, why are you here? What is this? What's happening here? Madam please... We are almost at the end of the case. Already we got the information. Mr.Siva is going into the network of kidnappers. Please Ma'am. What do you mean? Do you all want to kill him? Don't think about me now, ma'am. Think of the families... ...who are under distress every day thinking about their missing loved ones. You are my patient. I should only think about you. That's my responsibility as a doctor. I'm saying this with the same responsibility, ma'am. In our country, 85 members per hour, 2,130 members per day, and 65,000 people per month are going missing, including kids and elders, ma'am. If a person dies, we'll feel sad for a few days. If the same person goes missing, we'll recall them for our whole life and feel sad. Mr.Siva, you are already in a problem. It's not right for you to get into another problem. If we are afraid of the problem we can do nothing ma'am. If we face the problem with courage, we will find the answer. You don't have permission in the department. Sometimes, we don't need permission to work, ma'am. When we wear the khaki uniform, we take on the responsibility of protecting, ma'am. I'll go and complain to the judge. You may do whatever you want, ma'am. By the time I'll have to attend the court tomorrow, I'll bring everyone that went missing. Whoever is behind this dark crime... wherever they are... I will bring them out. Mr.Edwin. - Yes sir. Have you seen the BBC and the CNN news? No, sir. What happened? The UK and France are also going to start clinical trials to make artificial blood. Creating viruses like COVID-19, later making vaccines and making money from them... This is not enough. If my monopoly has to run in the world's Pharma and medicine industries, I should make artificial blood before anyone. How long will it take for you to finish the trails? We are on the way to hit the target, sir. We've divided all the people you have provided into different groups.. and we have injected the artificial blood which we have made into the human blood We did our best sir. Almost 60% of our work is successful. I hope for the better results within a year. What the freak? One more year? I have been waiting for the results for three years. I don't have time anymore. I gave you hundreds of people until now. I'll even give you thousands more. I want result in six months. In the future generations, every person's body should be filled not with the blood of their parents... ...but with the blood that Bhatia made. Hey, he is escaping! Catch him. [man groaning] [man screaming] Once you're here, there's no escaping. You should only die after my work is done. Hey! Is anyone thinking of escaping after seeing this? Take him away, treat his leg and inject the next dose. [tracker beeping] Guys, be alert. Van has entered. Sir turned on the GPS tracker. - OK, sir We are alert. - yes sir It's been 20 minutes since the tracker was turned on. There's been no movement since then. So, he is still there. Something is happening there, Reddy. Go! Go! Go! What happened, sir? Mr.Siva went missing. What do you mean, sir? We have to produce him in court tomorrow sir. What happened? Both of their heartbeats are 60-65. But he has 85-90. That means he is conscious. Shift these three to the observation room. - Okay, sir. Mr.Edwin. This is the report of the three clients that came in today. Two males and one female. This 32- year old male blood group is B positive. Seems like he had a neurosurgery. He has a head injury. His heartbeat is 85-90. What do you want us to do? We need such kind of typical clients. Give normal anaesthesia to all three of them and raise one more dose for him. Keep him under observation for one week Mr.Varma.. - Yes sir. give him a double dose of anaesthesia. Edwin. What about the positions of levels one, two and three? Level one and two are okay, sir. OK, sir. But in level 3... O positive group clients are getting badly affected by the third dose. They are getting bubbles all over their skin. One client's condition is too critical. I think it's better to delay it for one week. If I hear the word 'delay' again... Get the doses ready. [machine beeping rigorously] [machine beeping rigorously] [man groaning] [machine beeping rigorously] [man groaning] [machine stops beeping] Mr.Edwin. Mr Varma! Dispose the body. How long has she been missing for? - Since yesterday, sir. She's studying in 10th grade in Adarshavidyalayam. My daughter is missing sir. [indistinct voices] Sir, please lift up the body. What are you thinking, sir? Are you sad that I threw an old guy? I threw a five year old girl yesterday, sir. Dad! You are Varsha, right? - Yes. Listen to me carefully. I'll give you the keys. Take them and release all the other patients. Varsha, don't be tense. I'm a policeman. Okay, sir. Release everyone, faster! Be careful. [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] Hello, police... Look here once.. Please Police... Hello, police... [indistinct voices] Dad! Lucky! Come all of you Go and release all of them. Come on quick... Aparna! Aparna! Aparna! Where are you? Siva! Siva! Siva! Aparna! Mom! What happened Siva? - I'm fine, Aparna. Mom! Take care of Lucky! Take care of her. Careful. Careful. Mom! Mom! - Don't worry.. I'm there for you. I'll take you all out Please don't go leave us alone. I'll take you all out Siva! Siva! Police! Police! Wake up, Police! I'm scared. Please take me and mom from here, Police! If a police guy came here, it means they got to know about us, sir. No, no, no, no. If they knew, dogs would've already come here to smell. If they didn't, it means he came in alone searching for his wife and daughter. First throw his wife and daughter into the incinerator. Later throw him, too. Police! Wake up! Come... All this time I thought you were wrong, Siva. But I now understand that my thinking is wrong. Please forgive me, Siva. [Media people indistinct voices] Please patience.. patience.. Please, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. CI Sivakumar has killed those four people under self defence. It's been proved in the court. Very soon Sivakumar will start his duty as a CI. Okay. Have you complained to the judge? I did. But this time he told me to take care that you don't escape from the hospital. Siva! When you haven't come home at the correct time, I thought that duty is more important for you than family. But... I couldn't understand that you were saving another family at that time, Police. Keep going... Police Persevere. HAPPY ENDING
