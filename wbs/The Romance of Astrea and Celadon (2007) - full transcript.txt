To mix with the girls, wearing a frock, and was picked to play Paris! His girlish face took everyone in. Did Astrea recognize him? I don't know. They say she blushed uncomfortably. But then again, he was wearing a turban and beard. She kept any doubts to herself, for the sinner ran the risk of being stoned to death. I hope they'd have spared him because of his youth. What ails you, boy? Secluding yourself in the woods away from human company? Can it be reasonable at your age to desert your flock, your kith and kin, and live like a wild bear? You say your love for Astrea drives you to it. But child, reflect. If you have wronged her, you cannot make amends from afar. And if you did her no wrong, how can you prove your innocence? Previously, I agree, you had some reason to avoid her. But now it is time to come to your senses and show her you are notjust a lover but also a man. Being a man is the least of my concerns. A man's memory is all I have left. I have lost all wit and willpower. My only defence is that I am in love. If you are in love, should you not strive to see your beloved? If I'm in love, how can I go against her wishes? How can I disobey her? Or rather, how can I not love to obey her? She ordered me to stay away. But she is unaware of your obedience! Lovers are amply satisfied by knowing we have done our duty. Celadon, I see you are hard to convince. My advice to you was dictated by kindness and my duty as a druid. Don't take it amiss. But I ask you one thing, a favour you cannot refuse. You see, my daughter, whom I love, lives with the druid girls, far away. My fondness for you grows, the more I see your face It reminds me of hers. You look so similar. I hope you will not mind if I disturb you now and then for the pleasure of seeing my dearest treasure's likeness. Thereafter, frequent visits from Leonida and the druid lifted Celadon's spirits. Use this to write down your poems. #Here my beauteous sun reposes# #When the lazy sun retires# #In the morning, when its fires# #Glow afresh with pinks and roses# #Banishing the night-time's fears# #Long before the dawn appears# #The sun which my heart embraces# #Lights the firmament above# #Bestowing on the land its graces# #And filling it with love# #All along this riverside# #It shows itself in different ways# #Sometimes shining all ablaze# #Sometimes covering its light# #As if it suddenly were jealous# #And tried to steal away from us# #Just as, behind a sombre cloud, # #The sun conceals its radiance# #Although it knows a flimsy shroud# #Can never hide its brilliance# #My shepherdess, in days gone by# #Clasped my hand and promised me# #'Whatever blind fate may decree# #To be our mortal destiny# #To Celadon I pledge my troth# #With this everlasting oath# #By this hand I swear to adore you# #If you live or if you die# #Or, if I should die before you# #In my grave our love will lie'# #O secret, rocky places# #Where we kept our trysts# #Now, what more exists# #Of those lost embraces? # #Will the gods whom we entreated# #Let their powers now be cheated# #And allow our ardent prayers, # #Hers and mine, to be in vain# #Since she now our love forswears# #And repays it with disdain? # This carefree idleness is bad for you. I'll take you to a sacred grove. You can build an arbour to embellish it. The grove around this tree is sacred to Teutates, Esus, Belenus and Taranis, our God. Father, you said four names, one God? Why not 'gods'? Are these four gods not the same as the gods we call Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Apollo? No, child. They were given those names by the Roman invaders, who worship several gods. But they are not gods to us. So who are they? That is one of our great mysteries. There can be only one God. He is almighty or nothing. If there were two almighty gods, their power would be split. Also, they would be either identical or different. If identical, they would be one and the same thing. If they were different, then goodness must be different from goodness, which is impossible. I've always believed in a sovereign God above all others. Butjust as mortal kings have junior officers, I thought there could be junior gods. I saw Teutates as the chief with Esus, Taranis and Belenus worshipped below him. They are all names of our great Teutates. Then why, in our temples and here, are there statues of Hercules, Venus, Pallas, Diana, and Mars? Aren't they gods? Only to the Romans. You should regard them, not as separate gods, but as several virtues of one God. In Jupiter, you worship God's greatness and majesty, in Mars, His power, in Pallas, His wisdom, and in Venus, His beauty. So doing, you will relate them all to our great Teutates. The Romans forced their idols on us but we do not revere them as gods because our God is One. If I dared to teach you our holy mysteries and our religion's deepest secrets, I would quote a wise druid, who said: The names of Esus, Taranis and Belenus together signify a single God. The Strong God, the Man God, and the Resurgent God. The Strong God is the Father, the Man God the Son, and the Resurgent God is Love. All three make one, Teutates. To the Man God's mother, the ancient druids raised an altar with a statue of a virgin cradling a child, inscribed 'To the virgin mother. ' But these mysteries are beyond you. Some are even beyond me, a druid. I'll say no more lest I profane them. Let's change the subject. You may build around this tree a shrine devoted, not to Teutates, since we Celts are forbidden to make images of God, but to Astrea, the Roman goddess and Celtic symbol of virtue and justice. We could give her the features of your fair shepherdess, if you have the memory and artistry. Father, I'm no artist. As for her likeness, I can lend you this if you promise to return it. Your folly is beautiful indeed. I never saw a fairer face nor one that shows more modest love. Lucky the father who begot her and the mother who raised her. Luckier still, the man who wins her love, and her. In late spring, the shepherd folk travelled to the Mistletoe Feast at Adamas's castle. 'Unbelievers, venture slowly If your love is less than holy Come not near In this sacred grove A heart fed on love Reveres divine Astrea' Is this ourjourney's end? By no means. I do not know this place. These poles are obviously new. See? The knots are still fresh. The boughs have not yet taken root. The leaves will grow again next spring. Let's enter with respect. Not I. It is no place for me. I believe my love is true although you, Lycidas, disagree. I know that I'm in love with love but I cannot vouch for its holiness. I was always told never to trifle with the gods. So you're deserting us? Aren't you ashamed of your impure love? Far from it. If you understood me, you'd praise me. I'm staying outside because I respect this temple's deity while you brazenly walk in and desecrate it, knowing in your heart, despite your protestations, that your love is not properly holy. Great goddess of this place, behold me. I enter your sacred grove respectful of your will. I know my love is fit and pure. If it is not, punish my effrontery. Two Cupids signify the lover and beloved competing to see whose love is the greater. Their bows, inextricably entwined, teach us that they share all things. One's strength is the other's. Their wills are utterly combined. As wise men say, lover and beloved are one. The Twelve Rules of Love. Rule One. 'The perfect lover must love infinitely. Only extreme love is worthy. Mediocrity is closer to betrayal than to fidelity. ' Rule Two. He must love in a single place and revere its every aspect. All the happiness he seeks must be for that one subject. ' I don't believe that a single word you said is written on that tablet! Others here can read. Show it to me. The perfect lover must #not #love infinitely. He must love in #many #places and #always #have eyes for #new #places! The happiness he seeks must be for #many #objects. ' For that one object! For that one object! Shame on your sacrilege. I didn't go in. Stay outside and be quiet. Does that portrait remind you of anyone? It's our Astrea! Who could have painted it here? Is it not you? Nobody here knows me. How strange. Yes, I don't understand. And what about this? 'Bereft of my true good, this false good comforts me. Traveller, if you wonder who gave me this portrait, the answer is that Love, bereft of its true good, with this false good comforts me. ' Sister, this place amazes me! Me too. I can't tell if I'm asleep or awake. I even remember him writing that line, 'Bereft of my true good, this false good comforts me' on the back of a portrait he wore around his neck. Did someone steal it from his body or find it on the riverbank? Don't cry! This is a reason to be glad, not sad. See? He wrote it himself, as sure as I am Phyllis. It could be forged. Not that well. If he wrote it, he can't have died by drowning, as you thought. If so, what could be better news? Sister, please, do not talk like that. Celadon is dead. The shepherds saw him washed away. I won't say he's alive, but still... if he wrote this, he cannot be dead. Haven't you heard our druids say the soul lives on after the body dies? I've heard it. Don't you remember they constantly teach us to bury our dead and place coins in their mouths to pay the ferryman to Pluto's realm? And do you not know that Celadon's body, being unfound, forwent that final act of mercy? His soul is probably drifting up and down that wretched river! Possibly. But I'm saying he's alive because I hope he is, for your sake. I know that, sister. But if I believed he were alive and found out he was dead, nothing could keep me alive. I would have lost him twice. If he is dead, as you think and I do not, you must feel comforted to know that death could not efface his love. Which adds to my loss. If he is dead, he can see quite clearly that your love is pure and true and the jealousy that made you angry came from that great love. They say thatjust as we have eyes, so our souls can see and recognize each other. That's my only consolation. I think we're lost. Any ideas? No. You're supposed to know best. I admit I'm a blind man leading the blind. The trouble is, our blindness arose from trusting your eyes! If you weren't here, we wouldn't be blind. Why not? Did I steal your eyes? My eyes, no, but our vision. You waxed on about your infidelities and fooled with the rules of love until the night was upon us. You sound like those people who praise the wine and then blame it for making them drunk. 'Friends,' we should answer, 'why drink so much? ' Friend Lycidas, why did you listen to me? Did I capture your ears? In any case, we're lost. We need daylight to pick our way out of here. We'll rest under those trees until dawn. #Walking deep in thought, # #Celadon was suddenly astounded# #to come across Astrea. # #She had a kerchief over her eyes, # #a hand behind her head and the other on her thigh. # #Her smock, raised inadvertently, # #revealed her lovely leg. # #What a sight for Celadon! # #Surprise rooted him there, # #bereft of pulse and breath, # #gazing insatiably at these delights# #and wishing he had, like Argus, # #eyes all over his body. # #As he feasted his eyes, # #he said to himself, # #'Away! # #Remember her prohibition! '# #But he could not help approaching. # What is it? Hold still. Am I hurting you? What makes you so pale? Alas, sister! What did I see? What was it? I saw Celadon. His mortal coil. You dreamed him. Don't be afraid. Only fools believe in dreams. In our sleep, our mind replays the things we saw and thought by day. Dreams don't predict the future. They reflect the past. It wasn't a dream. I saw him! When he saw me looking at him, he melted away! Perhaps you dreamed you were awake. It often happens. I was awake. I opened my eyes and saw my shepherd's soul. God, it was so beautiful and bright! Only the sun shines brighter. It dazzled me but vanished in a flash. Do you believe me? Unlike you, I can't believe he's dead. This apparition seems to prove he is alive. But I agree, don't raise your hopes. If it really is his soul, all we can do is give him the mercy of a grave. I think you should raise a tomb to him. An empty tomb. A cenotaph. It is our custom for warriors and victims of fire and flood. Come on. It's time to go. She's truly beautiful. Did you know? She says she saw Celadon's soul. Souls are invisible. Silly girl! She saw the man himself. She thinks he's dead. I can't dissuade her of it. But it seems like a good opportunity to rescue the shepherd from his misery. When he hears how she misses him, he will resolve to see her. Let us find him. I'm delighted to find you so cheerful. What happened? I saw Astrea. I gazed on her asleep. Did she see you? I left before her eyes opened. She saw you run away. She thinks it was your soul. She came to the castle. She wants to build a tomb. She loves and mourns you. If you do not see her now, you have no courage or love. Courage, I lack. Not love. I can't believe you love her if, knowing she loves you you persist in avoiding her. Love commands me to obey her. She ordered me to stay away. You say I lack love by obeying her? She hated you then. Now she loves you! Even so, she ordered me. Even so, I will obey her! You already disobeyed by looking at her. She didn't forbid me to see her, only to be seen by her. She was asleep. If that is so, you can see her, unseen, every day. Must she be asleep? Must I hide? No, you may even talk to her. In the dark? In broad daylight. Do you remember I said you resemble my daughter, Alexia? I'll announce she is ill and coming home to recover. You can pass for a girl with your delicate face and fair skin. Father, my beard is only light but if I shave it off, it shows. I will give you a herb to make it vanish completely. Your rumoured sickness will let you speak softly. No need. I can falsify my voice when I sing... but also when I speak. Adamas wants to see you. This is the daughter I told you of. I hope your company will revive her. How may I mark this day that brings the joy of meeting you? The joy is mine for being here at the Mistletoe Feast. My father spoke of a newly built shrine. Did he take you there? Not yet. It's nearby. If you come to the window, I'll show you the oak tree where it is built. See, on the right, a prominent tree? I see it. To which deity is it devoted? In fact, she bears my name. The goddess Astrea, dressed as a shepherdess. Strangely, those who have seen her including myself, agree she looks like me. It was a wise choice. Astrea, the goddess ofjustice, is best portrayed as a shepherdess with her sheep since justice brings peace and plenty to mankind. But it was wiser still to give her your face. Astrea has deserted us for the newcomer. She pays us no more heed than if we were strangers! Doesn't she look like someone we know? Like who? I don't know. Her father? No, a shepherdess. A shepherd, rather. Celadon. No wonder she is eager to be with her! Here is your room. It was my daughter's. Coming back to it may bring back her health. But tell me, Alexia. How does Celadon feel? I haven't heard from him. Speaking for Alexia, she swears she was never happier. But you, Celadon. Do you regret believing me? No one could regret taking your advice. Dangerous though it is. I see your ailment is not yet ready for the cure that I prescribed. I bid you good night. #The long-awaited day# #broke too slowly for the sleepless Celadon. # #Berating the sun's laziness, # #he begged the dawn to open heaven's gates. # #Tell me, # #what offence# #or sin of mine# #Has made you slow your gradual traverse? # #Minutes, you are days# #Days, you are years# #Creeping towards an end that never nears# #Century after century# #you rehearse# #Penelope's daily work# #that nightly disappears# #I think the sun is moving in reverse... # Who's there? It's us! See what pretty girls I've brought to help you rise? Good morning! And to you, fair shepherdesses. How was your night? Should I answer for her? I warrant she slept here beside you. Beside me? In mind, if not in body. It is quite possible. I pondered our conversation all night. What's this, my girl? Still in bed? What will these maidens think of your idleness? Father, it's her fault for bursting in with them. It is your fault for lying abed. They should give you a hiding to get you up sooner! Come, shepherdesses. Alexia can get dressed without you. If you will, let's spend today together. And tomorrow. I am bewildered to be granted the joy of your company. Fair shepherdess, the joy is mine. In truth, I've had no greater pleasure since I left home than the joy of seeing you. I could never doubt your word but I hardly see how a poor wretched girl like me could possibly deserve such favour. Fair shepherdess, I never lie but if I did, I'd rather die than lie to you. Promise you'll agree to let me spend my life with you. Astrea. I'm afraid... you may soon change your mind. If you knew me well, you would know that is impossible. I never go back on my decisions. #Celadon fell silent# #and stepped back# #with the same look in his eye# #as when she ordered him out of her sight. # What is it? You suddenly seem different. I hope it's not because of me. Have I displeased you? Fair shepherdess, it's not your fault. My heart reacted too keenly to the words you spoke. You see, among the druid girls I chose a bosom friend. I took to her so dearly because I thought she loved me. I could not live without her. She felt the same for me, she said. But then, after several years, my fair beloved left me. She refuses to see me without saying why. The shock of her reversal threw me into my present illness. How could someone so beautiful and perfect as you have met such a foolish girl? Do not blame her. Blame the dark star I was born under. The shepherdesses are waiting. Your long discussions with that girl make me think that our shepherdesses please you more than the shepherds. It is only natural to be fond of our own kind. My heart has room for shepherds too. Does not a druid maiden's education teach you more about the laws of nature? I should repair the omission. Don't waste your time and trouble. #Unbelievers, venture slowly# #If your love is less than holy# #Come not near# #In this sacred grove# #A heart fed on love# #Reveres the divine# #Astrea. # Since we are lodging the local druids, Alexia must share the girls' room. Astrea, Phyllis and I can sleep here and Alexia there. Astrea will want to sleep with Alexia. Tell Astrea that she must sleep with me. Tell her druid girls must sleep alone. Girls, I have many guests so you must share this room tonight. Three in the large bed, Leonida and the shepherdesses. Alexia in the small one, because druid maidens must always sleep alone. Daughter, our festivities have tired you. You deserve a longer sleep than usual. Get up after the others. Why look so sad? Have no fear. Be brave! Girls, good night to you. Shepherdess, let's get undressed. Alexia falls asleep as soon as she's in bed. If we go to bed after her and make a noise, she'll never get back to sleep. Sisters, would you mind letting your hair down here, to keep me awake? #Astrea, by now almost undressed, # #casually let slip her gown# #below her elbow, unveiling her breast. # #Alexia sat up and helped her# #to unfasten her bows and pins. # #Whenever her hand came near her mouth, # #she kissed it# #and Alexia kissed the place her lips had touched. # #Fair druid girl, # #Leonida spared you the pain# #of preventing your gaze! # #No breast was ever snowier, # #no apple in Love's orchard ever lovelier. # #Never did Cupid's arrow strike Celadon's heart# #as deeply as it did Alexia's. # #How nearly she dropped her girlish guise# #for that of a shepherd! # #How close she came to recklessness! # Good morning, Phyllis. You're up early. Why, it's Alexia! Is it not? That's my dress. It suits you perfectly. Is it really Alexia under those clothes? Let me kiss you, the loveliest shepherdess in the land. Lovelier than as a druidess. Are those not Astrea's clothes? What if Astrea dressed up as a druid girl? Each would be mistaken for the other. But what would my father say? He will only laugh. He knows gaiety is the best medicine for you. Be careful, Alexia! Astrea might be irked by your embrace. Nothing can irk me in Alexia's company. I would be sorry to irk you. But Leonida is only envious. Indeed? I have a lovely shepherdess right by me. #Unaware that her caresses were closer# #than is usual between girls, # #Astrea welcomed and returned her kisses# #as though Alexia# #were a living image of Celadon. # Who are you? You're not Alexia! I am Astrea. Isn't this her dress? You're Celadon! Celadon is dead. Yes. I'm dreaming. Almighty God, let this not be a dream! Let him be alive! I am alive. Live, live, Celadon! I order you! Subtitles by Nigel Palmer
