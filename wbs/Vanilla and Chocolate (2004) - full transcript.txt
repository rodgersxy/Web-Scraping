Ripped, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! You can do it, Pepe. VANILLA AND CHOCOLATE Liar! That Stefania from the paper you're shagging... came crying to me! - It's your imagination! - Don't touch me! Leave me alone. I'm not mad! Talk quietly or you'll wake the kids. - You're the only one I love. - You liar! - I'd never sleep with another woman. - You're a liar! Keep your voice down. It's true! Understand? Dear Andrea, curse of my life. I've threatened before to leave but didn't do it. Now, I'm leaving. You know how slow yet strong-minded I am in making decisions. I've weighed up your selfishness and lies in these years of marriage. And your fears, your childishness. I don't want to know how you'll cope without me, seeing that you can't even open a can of beer on you own. If you want to survive, you'll learn to fend for yourself, our children and the house. It won't be easy to pay the bills at the post office and the bank. Or dealing with the tax forms and the daily shopping list. From now on, look after the kids, the most complex thing we have. How will you find the time and energy to do your favourite sports: lying, betraying and not caring for your family. You don't charm me anymore. You're a child that won't grow up. When we got married, I was too young to realize that. I'm in the same predicament as millions of women. We're victims. You can tell the kids I took a holiday in order to rest. Don't come looking for me. If you do, I'll return just to get the kids and leave you forever. For the first time you're alone with responsibilities and the kids. I hope you can all be of help to each other. I'm going to my grandma's house to be alone and to think. Penelope. I don't believe it! - Hello? - It's me, don't hang up. - I don't want to speak to you. - Wait, calm down! - I just want to understand. - What? - You've never understood anything! - I'll write you a letter then. Fuck off! Shit! - They argued. - That's a surprise! - What terrible parents we have! - I can't stand them. I hate them. We could kill them! That's a thought. How? - I'll kill you first! - Dad, we knew you were there! - It was a joke. - A joke? Swear! - I swear on your life. - I'm dead then! I'm going to the office. Lucia, you have two hours to sort out the kitchen and make lunch. - I don't want to eat. - Your brothers do. Ask Priscilla, I'm not your slave. What a cow to walk out on a Sunday! - Don't be paranoid. - Listen, Daniele. - Take the dog out and feed him. - Or else? Or else... Or else I'll make sure you're sorry. This is an emergency. I want a change of tune from today, got that? What the hell is his problem? - Professor Briganti? - Who is it? - It's Penelope. Pepe! - Penelope! The Penelope whose man fought the Gods for his thirst of knowledge! What are you doing in this hill-billy town? I'm sorry to bother you but I have no water or electricity. - May I use your bathroom? - Of course, come in! Don't get lost in the rooms of the castle! - Shall I make you a coffee? - A double one. With Neapolitan water, this one comes from Santa Lucia. Otherwise the coffee tastes gross! - Good morning. - Hi. Hi, Andrea! - Good morning, Rosati. - Hi, Andrea. You got something for me? What's this? - This is what you wanted. - Done. Good morning everyone. I know, I'm late. - That's alright with me. - Excuse me. - You deal with this. - Alright. Hi, Andrea. What the hell did you say to my wife? Sorry, but I felt guilty. I felt sorry for her. No, you just cleared your conscience. There's nothing between us, at least on your part. I'm just one of your many lays, I know that. That's what you think. The truth is that I love my wife and I can't live without her! Come on, let's be friends. No hard feelings. Fuck off! Andrea, have you handed in your expenses receipts? They won't refund the car hire because the receipt's wrong! Leave me alone, I'm in so much shit you can't imagine! Irene! - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Come in, Mom's in the living room. Pepe, relax your arms. Let your fingers fly over the keys. You have to anticipate the second eighth-note. It's Chopin. You can't just play it any old way. Try again. Mom, Mr. Ogioni's here. - Greetings, madam. - How kind of you to come. My daughter said you would give me a hand. Even two, if I can, madam. Pepe. Stop now. We have to talk, grown-up's stuff. Go to your room or in the garden. Sorry. We'll start again as soon as I've finished. Don't disappear. That's my daughter. Her real name's Penelope. - That's a nice name. - Aren't you going to say hello? Good morning. My mother's got herself into a real mess. She's already sold the farmhouse and the land. If I hadn't stopped her, she would have sold this house too. That's typical of women born into wealth. They don't take into account the repercussions of their fortune. Hi, how are you? Did you sleep well? Piccarda! Go back to sleep. Why are you here? Did you get lost? Come on, I'll take you back to the professor. Professor! Professor Briganti! Little girl, the professor's over there. Were you looking for me? I brought Piccarda back to you, she was in my garden. Damn, Piccarda! You know you mustn't stray! I forgive you, Piccarda. Thanks, Pepe. - Why did you call her that? - It's from the Divine Comedy. Piccarda Donati was a blessed women that Dante met in Paradise. She was a distant relative of Dante. She became a nun. - How old is she? - Piccarda Donati? - No, the tortoise. - She's old, but not as old as me. Why don't you get a cat? Grandma says cats are playful. - Tortoises aren't. - But I talk to my tortoise! You see, she's doing that with her head because she wants to be forgiven! I forgive you, Piccarda! I still have a block of flats and a house that I'm renting out. Then there are my jewels. And my Colombian emerald. It's pure, with no carbon. My husband gave it to me, blessed man! He brought it back from South America. I'll go and get it. Alright. No, not here! Dad! Come here. - Penelope! - Dad! My goodness, you're beautiful! - You're here, at last. - You see? - When are we going on holiday? - Soon. - How are you, Mr. Pennigi? - Not too bad, dear Mr. Ogioni. - I'm keeping busy, and you? - Not bad. It's good to see you, but what brings you here? Business, your wife will explain everything. Excuse me, I have to go. Kind regards to your mother, madam. - With pleasure. - Have a good day. - How did it go? - There was traffic, the usual... - Do you think I've put on weight? - My darling, you're beautiful! Dear diary, I found Piccarda in my garden again today. And I took her back to the professor. Then I saw a young man and my heart leapt. But he didn't even notice me. What a pity, he was gorgeous! I'd better not write anymore. Otherwise I'd have to write about Mom and Mr. Ogioni. You know what my mom would do to me if she found you, dear diary? I don't think she'd like my thoughts. - Hello? - Penelope, what have you done? - What is it, Mom? - Andrea phoned. He's distraught! I don't care. - He can die as far as I care. - Do you realize what you're saying? You have responsibilities, three children, a family. They're not only my responsibilities. They're his too. Let him deal with them! For the moment, I've decided to think about my life. May I? What's happening to you, Penelope? - Do you want me to come over? - Mom, maybe you don't understand. I want to be alone, okay? I think you're making a mistake. You could be right, but at least this time it'll be my doing! Mom, will you do me a big favour? Stay out of my life. Dad, wake up. It's seven o'clock! Mozart! Dad, take the dog out, get my breakfast ready and take me to school. - Do you always wake up at this time? - Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. Bye, Daniele! Bye, Luca! Hurry up, we're late. Don't drag my bag! Come on! Bye, dad. - Bye, Luca. - Hi. Hi, how are you? - Who's that? Tell me. - If you give me my pocket money. What's mom been teaching you? Okay, I'll give it to you. His name's Roberto Tradati. He's got a moped and everyone calls him a "goody-goody" at school. I didn't finish the essay. Can we do it today? Bye. Dad, you have to fill in the menu. - What? - You have to choose my school dinner. - Mom used to do it. - Let's hurry up. I've double parked. - Pasta or rice? - Pasta. - Roast dinner or lamb chop? - Lamb chop. - Fries or salad? - Fries. What a stupid question! You're right. - Bye, little munchkin. - Bye. Hello, Luca. - How's it going? - I fixed the tap. But the wall's damp, the pipes need changing. - How long will that take? - If all goes well, a day. Sergio, hurry up. We have to change the pipes. Sacred Heart Institute, good morning. Yes, madam. Luca's playing. - Can I speak to him? - Right away, madam. Darling, it's me! How are you? Fine. - Did you take your Ventalin along? - Yes, Mom. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Aren't you playing in the garden? Are you listening? Luca? Are you angry with me? Mommy loves you, you got that? Are you there? You're wicked! Madam, we've finished. - How much do I owe you? - 200 euros. Wait, I'll get you an ashtray. Thanks, I didn't want to bother you. - There. - Thanks, madam. Dear diary, Grandma felt ill and was taken to hospital. I visit her every day. The doctors say she's got pneumonia. But Grandma's tough and she'll be okay if she stops smoking. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey. - How's Grandma? - A bit better. Hi, Grandma. How are you? Your arm's all bruised. Does it hurt? Shall I massage it for you? Look what I brought you. Listen. Do you like it? It's nice, isn't it? Just because I was ill for a few days, you all take advantage! My hair looks awful! Get me a hairdresser right away. What about my nails? No one bothered... - ..to put my nail varnish on. - I'll do it. Leave me alone. - Slowly. - Yes, easy does it. When I die, I want to wear my burgundy chiffon dress. - The one I wore for Rigoletto. - Don't say that, you're out of danger. One is never out of danger from death. You can go. Don't tire yourself out. You see your mother? She's always been like that, even as a kid. But you're different. Grandma... - Shall I get your nail varnish? - No, do something more useful. Get the vase of flowers and take what's inside. Bring it to me. But Grandma, you've had pneumonia! - I deserve one. - It's bad for you! It's my reward for being alive. Open the window. Play something for me. Grandma, I brought you these. Just in case you want one... This way you've got some. I'll miss you, Grandma. Goodbye, my dear Grandma. Caterina, Mom would like some more coffee. God! - See what you've done? - I didn't do it on purpose! - What's going on? - We fell over. Come on. Come in, sit down. I told you the moped was broken, but you don't listen! - Sorry. - I'll get you some water. Sorry to bother you. - What's happened? - My grandma died. - I'm sorry. Were you fond of her? - Very. - What's your name? - Penelope. - My friends call me Pepe. - Cute! - There. - Bye. Thanks. - Bye, Pepe. - Bye. Thanks, Grandma! Professor! Help me, I lied to my mom. I said I was coming here to study. But it's not true, I have to meet a friend. - You'll get me in trouble! - Please! Thanks! I'll go out through the garden and jump over the hedge. - Let's have a swim! - I haven't got my costume! Never mind, do this. - Ready? - Yes. One, two, three, go! Here's your liqueur. Nothing for you? Too bad! - Hi, Ciro. - Penelope! What are you doing here? - Who's this young man? - Andrea. Hi, Andrea. What can I get you? - Two cakes. - It's a miracle! Here they are. They're our speciality, vanilla and chocolate cakes. Strong and contrasting flavours which go very well together! Eat up, kids. How did you end up here? Hi! Here's some tuna, that way you'll eat. Who knows how long it's been since you ate. Come on, eat something. What is it? What a big tummy you have! Are you pregnant? Dear Penelope, I know how honest you are. I know you wrote the truth about what you think. I too can honestly say that I may have acted wrongly, but I am not the monster you describe. I behaved like an idiot, denying my affair with Stefania. The only excuse I have is that I'm scared of losing you. You forbid to come and get you and won't speak to me on the phone. You are punishing me, but I hope I can show you that I can change. Who's "M"? I found his letters. But I didn't read them. Dear Andrea, I reflected at length before replying to you. Your letter moved me with its frankness. In the end, I decided. I'll be frank too and tell you what I've kept secret for a long time. Even though it's over and belongs in the past. Pepe! How nice to see you again! - You look great! - You're too kind! - I'm always in a hurry! - Where are you rushing off to? - With three kids! - Here's the piano. - Nice, isn't it? - Yes, where did you get it? In London, in a furniture warehouse. I think it's beautiful. - It's not in great condition. - Why do you say that? - Look, the tuning table's broken. - I can't tell. - Where do you see it from, here? - Yes. I hadn't looked there. It needs tuning. - And repairing. - That too! - It might not be worth your while. - Why? - It depends on how much you paid. - Quite a bit. How much will it cost to repair? I'll find someone to repair it that won't charge a lot. - It's starting to rain. - Holy Mary! Bye. See you. - It's raining! - Yes. I know it sounds corny, but I watched you playing the piano and I wanted to talk to you. - Do you have a car? - No, I have to get a taxi. Here's one. Taxi! After you. I have to take a taxi too, can I come with you? Where are you going, miss? Home. I'm not a miss, I'm married. "And I took her to the river thinking she was a young lass! But she had a husband." Garcia Lorca. Your husband is a very lucky man. This is fine for me. How much do I owe you? Please, miss! It was a pleasure meeting you. My name's Carlos. I'm a painter. - I'm a pianist. - Bye. Hi, Léon! How are you? - You look well! - Thanks. Madam, a box was delivered for you. - Here. - Thanks. - Hello? - It's Carlos. Who gave you my number? A friend at the FBI. Thanks for the gloves and the chocolates. Did you like the box? - I made it myself. - You didn't! It was a work of art and I didn't realize! - Did you like the chocolates? - They were good, but... They have a strong flavour, what's in them? Chilli pepper, it's a Neapolitan speciality. Chilli pepper? Listen, I already told you I'm married... Yes, I know. But I'd like to invite you to the opening of my exhibition. Would you like to come? Thank you, but I don't think I'll have the time. Please come! I'll be expecting you, anyway. Goodbye. You came! - I came. - I'm so pleased. - Is this one of your paintings? - Yes. - Do you like it? - What does it represent? It represents my homeland. Spain, Catalonia. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. I must be missing something. - Well? - Hi, Léon. How are you? - Hi, Pepe. Are you surprised? - Hi. Is that your friend from the FBI? - I'd lost hope in you coming. - So had I. Something to drink? You have beautiful hands. I've always found them horrid! This is the best night of my life. I'm going home. - Do you want me to take you? - No, thanks. I'll get a taxi. I want to see you again. We won't be meeting again. Brahms. Late German Romanticism. What makes it special is that it's both powerful and tender. It's like a grown-up caressing a young child. You can feel that the hand is strong and gentle at the same time. Are you surprised? - Yes. - How are the students coming along? Good, thanks. - They're great kids. - All future concert players! I hope so. - What are you studying? - Brahms. I love Brahms and Nat King Cole! - What about Chopin? - Chopin and the Beatles. - And Sinatra? - And Beethoven? - And Schopenhauer? - And Hegel? Plato? Einstein? And Coca Cola. And Céline, Kafka and "Beauty and the Beast"? And chilli-pepper flavour chocolates? They're the best! I'm crazy about you. You know I'm married. - And I love my husband. - Unfortunately. I have to go. When will I see you again? Darling, Luca's got a fever. I know, he's got chickenpox. I think Lucia's got it too. - How long are you staying in Milan? - Two days. I'll be back the day after tomorrow. I hope I've remembered everything. What would I do without you? You know I think the world of you? Andrea Donelli's here. Are you ready? Shall we begin? Mr. Donelli, how are you? Let me introduce you to Eva. - Eva, have you met Andrea Donelli? - What a pleasure. This way. Come in, have a seat. The interview lasts five minutes, I'll tell you when. No personal questions. So, Eva, where did you get the idea for this spot? What made you want to act? It was easy because I love acting. And if you could play a part in an old film, which one would it be? I've never thought about it. Maybe... What's her name? Rosalyn O'Hara. In "Gone with the wind". That's one of my favourite films. When she says: "Tomorrow is another day." How do you handle your top model career alongside your love life? Stop! No personal questions. No, I want to answer that question. What does your boyfriend think about it? My boyfriend doesn't exist. Happy now? Thanks. - I hope to meet you again. - So do I. See you soon. Why don't you invite him to have a drink with us? - When's dad going to speak? - After this. - It'll be shit. - Stop swearing! - Let's watch National Geographic. - No, I want to see dad. Hello? - Who is it? - They hung up. Don't scratch yourselves or the marks will stay. I'll put some cream on, that way the itching will stop. - Why is your hair wet? - You don't give me time to dry it! - Mom, I'm thirsty. - Yes, darling. Are we staying with you tonight? Of course, are you happy? - But where's dad? - He's at work. He'll be back in a few days. Shall we call him to say hello? Let's dial the number. Let's surprise him, we'll tell him the blisters are healing. Andrea Donelli's room please. He'll answer now. Sorry, I got the wrong number. I got the wrong number, how stupid of me! Now it's time to sleep. We'll call him tomorrow. Good evening. Andrea Donelli's room, please. - Mr. Donelli. - Who's speaking? It's the editor from his newspaper. It's your newspaper. - Can we have a chat? - Yes. - Shall we go out? - No. Great, I'll take you to dinner. Chinese, Japanese or Indian food? I know a restaurant that uses chocolate in all its dishes. Spaghetti, chocolate and chilli pepper. - Come on, I'll pick you up. - I can't! Don't say no! - I can't! - Why? Come on! Come on! Mom, help me! - Help, mom. - What's wrong? Oh, my God! - What is it? - Oh, God! What is it? - What are you doing here? - What is it? - What's going on? - Daniele, come here! Don't go in, Daniele! Have you never seen a snake? His name's Igor. - Where did you get him? - From the pet shop. - Take him back immediately! - If he goes, I go too! Listen to your mom or I'll get angry. I'll keep what I want in my room! Say something to him! What do you want me to say? Daniele, I don't want that thing here when I get back! Darling, I have to go to work. I love you. Calm down, he heard you. See you tonight. Bye, munchkin. Look... I have to go. Each time you leave me is like a farewell. I want to have a child with you. - A child? - Yes. I have three already. Well, you have a husband too. But we love each other. Why don't you get a divorce? How can I? I have a family. Your children will live with us and we'll be a family. I know it's a difficult decision. I realize that. But think about it. It's been over for a long time. I wasn't betraying you because you neglected me, it happened because fate made me meet a wonderful man. I loved him passionately. I left him after much doubting and heart-ache, because I thought that after all, you were the love of my life. Penelope. I had kids with a whore! Kick that ball! I'll give you a lift. No, Roberto's here. I'll call you later. I don't know. I'll let you know. - What's wrong? You seem strange. - Do I? Why? - Just because. - Come on, let's go. I won't throw my arms around you, I won't say you did the right thing. I wasn't expecting you to. I see you're having some work done. Sorry, I should have asked you, seeing it's your house. You should patch up your marriage, not the house. You have three kids, think about it. It wasn't an easy decision. And it's not now either. I couldn't stand it any longer. - Sometimes I feel older than you. - What are you going to do? I don't know. And your affair with that painter? - Who told you? - Your husband. He came to see me, he was distraught. He told me everything. Do you want to talk about it? - It's over. - How "over"? You're good at keeping secrets! You've been good at that since you were a kid! What are you talking about? I knew you'd seen me in this room that day. I've never forgiven myself. That's when you started hating me, isn't it? But you can understand me now. Have you come to tell me we're equals? Do you think I'm the same as you? - Tell me. - You see? You hate me. But I didn't come to criticize you, nor to be criticized. I came to talk. To you. We haven't done that for a long time. We never have, actually. I was in love with that man. What was I supposed to do? Leave everything and run away with him? If you must know, we're still seeing each other now. But I never felt I could abandon your father. Because, despite everything, I can't imagine my life without him. You've done what I didn't do, but I understand you. Sorry. I love you. Good morning. - What are you doing here? - I'm waiting for Lucia. - Do you want to come up? - No, thanks. Can I ask you something? Lucia says you're an expert on women. - That's what she says? - Yes. For two days, Lucia's been going out with an older guy. - What should I do? - Do you love her? - Yes. - So hang on to her. You can't afford to lose her. - Where are you going? - I'm taking her to the gym. - She's got her training session. - Is this guy her coach? More or less. What are you two up to? Plotting against you. Good morning, can I speak to Carlos? It's Penelope. Didn't you give him my messages? I see. You don't know when he'll be back? Alright. Goodbye. Good girl! Get that ball back! Quick! Keep your eyes on the action! Go, Lucia! Lucia. When you hit the ball back, keep your arms higher. Like this, alright? Go on! That's it! Go on! Did you hurt yourself? Did you bang your knee? Does it hurt? Let's have a look. - No, it's nothing serious. - Better cover it up. - Is everything alright? - Yes. Hi, I'm Raoul Graziani, the new coach. - I'm Lucia's dad. - Your daughter's very good. I'd like to have her on the team. She had an operation on her foot when she was 13, it's not the right sport! Dad! - I wasn't aware of that. - Nice meeting you. Goodbye. I hate you! Come on, let's start again! Why did you tell him about my foot? I could have killed you! - Give it to me. - No. - I don't like your coach. - Why? He's got a nasty, stupid face. I hate you. I can't stand you when you're like this. Come on, I'm just trying to protect you. Yes, alright... Why do you kiss Roberto but not me? You've got a cat! Actually, she chose me. - Can you look after her? - Are you going home? Professor, I'm going to jump over the hedge again. What? - Good morning, Cesira. - Good morning, madam. - Carlos? - He's not here. Where is he? He went out. I called you lots of times. I know. So, you don't want to see me again. Pepe, people change, life changes. Everything changes. I haven't seen you for two years. Tell me about you. It all began with a spot on my leg. And then? I've got cancer, Pepe. Why didn't you tell me? Should I have written or phoned to tell you I was ill? What would you have done? I don't need tears, pity irritates me. The truth terrifies me. I love life. I've even managed to hate those who love me. My mother, my brother, my friends. They all feel they have to console me. Pepe, I don't want to hate you too. Death has no friends. I didn't want you to know. When you called to ask to see me, I wanted to say no. But then weakness made me give in. - Is that the only reason? - No, you know. I'm pleased to see you, my love. - The doctor's here. - I'm coming. I'm going now. I'm glad you stayed. I'm sorry, I woke you up. I was dreaming. But now, you're here and I'm still dreaming. You always say beautiful things. You've made me very happy by coming here. I'm scared, Pepe. Maybe it's for the best. Do you know this poem? "The most beautiful sea hasn't been crossed yet. Our most beautiful child hasn't grown up yet. Our most beautiful days, we haven't lived yet. And the most beautiful words I wanted to tell you, I haven't said yet." - Cesira, I can't find Carlos. - He left early this morning. He said you'd understand. Shall I get your breakfast ready? No, thanks. I'm sad, Grandma. I'm hurting so much. Who told you life was easy? I didn't, that's for sure. If you don't suffer, you can't even say you're alive. Lucky you, you can keep your kids and forget about their dad. What's going on? Luca! Wait, I'll get him. Oh, God! My darling! - Where's Luca? - This way, come on. Wait! Madam, wait! - You can't come in. - I'll just be a moment. Mom. What are you doing, munchkin? - Can you breathe? - Why did you leave? Mommy's here with you now. He's better now, he just felt funny. Go out, please. It's probably a form of psychosomatic illness. Luca picks up tension, instability. Therefore he shows his uneasiness by getting short of breath. You see... I don't know whether things are good between you. Whether you're together... But that's his problem. His parents are his problem. Aren't the kittens afraid of the tortoise? No, the tortoise is friendly. Piccarda is very friendly. She'd like to mother the kittens. Look what she's doing! Careful, don't drop it. - What do you want to call it? - Which one? This one? - Little cloud. - Little cloud! - And this one? - Fatty. - Fatty's cute! - It's nice. What about this one? - Little blanket. - Little blanket! - What is it? Do you need to wee? - No. Are you checking up on me? Carry on, I'll wait here for you. - Are you afraid I'll run off again? - Yes. Mommy told you she won't leave again. I'll always stay with you. And when's dad coming back? I don't know. You're having problems. Are you going to divorce? - I don't know. - Was I here when you got married? - No, you weren't. - What about Daniele and Lucia? They weren't either. So why did you get married then? Because one morning I looked out of the window and I saw a great big banner. - It said: "Will you marry me?" - What did you do? I ran downstairs and gave your father a big hug. - We were in love. - And you're not anymore? Now there's someone I love much more. You're mommy's real love! I love you lots. There. Pepe, come here! Put it here. - Give me the plates. - Is everything alright, darling? Pepe, you look wonderful. Thanks. - It's so hot today! - It's unbearable. - It's so humid! - Tell me about it! Professor, if you need to undo your tie... - Do I have the ladies' permission? - Of course! Thank you. Luca, do you know there's a town party for San Lorenzo's night? What is San Lorenzo's night? It's the night of the falling stars. If you see a falling star, you must make a wish. Alright. I want another Game Boy. Grandpa, why is you hair so long? Sheer vanity! My husband's always had long hair. Mimě, do you know that since you've gone grey, you look more attractive? Really? "O fleece, that down the neck waves to the nape! O curls! O perfume nonchalant and rare!" "Ecstasy". Baudelaire. What's the tortoise's name? - Piccarda. - Why? Because Piccarda was a blessed woman Dante met in Paradise. Piccarda Donati. "The Divine Comedy." - Mimě! - Yes? We're here. - See how many stars? - Yes. - I even made a wish. - What was it? I'll tell you later! Alright. It's beautiful, I've never seen you wear it. It was a present. Who from? I saw him again. For the last time. I'm pleased to hear you say that. Your husband's changed a lot. You know, don't you? He's become a good father. And he really loves you. I've only loved two men in my life. My husband and a dream. PAINTER MARTINEZ DIES - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Donelli. See you tomorrow. Dearest Pepe, I had climbed to the top of a really tall tree. Someone shook it and I fell down. Then I had to face reality and accept it. You love your husband, you've always loved him. I'm an out-of-tune note between you. You were born to be Andrea's wife, not mine. I'm leaving you and I'm tiptoeing away. The sun will never be as warm without you. Nor will the grass be so green. I'll keep you in my heart. And I hope to find a doorway into your dreams some day. Hello? It's me. - What time is it? - It's six o'clock. - Has something happened? - No. I'm at the tower. Why don't you join me? Hi. Hi. I wanted to see you. You look well. I read about Martinez. I went to see him. I loved him for his suffering. I read his letters. To understand. You remember twenty years ago, when we were kids, we used to go swimming and you would be shy to show yourself naked? Twenty years ago we didn't have three children. And the fourth one's on its way. I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? You're only just telling me now? Who's the father? I don't know. This child is mine. Because I love you. Understood? I thought such a beautiful moment would never happen again. Sometimes, happiness returns. May I? Here we are. The house speciality, vanilla and chocolate cakes. Strong flavours... which go very well together. Right! He hasn't changed! Ready? TO MY FRIEND AUGUSTO BAUMANN "A LIFE DEDICATED TO FILMS." -- English --
