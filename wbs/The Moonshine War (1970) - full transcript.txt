[country music] ? In Louisville Kentucky back in ?32 ? ? A man named Son Martin was makin? mountain brew ? ? If it wasn?t for his whiskey he wouldn?t have a dime ? ? ?Cause two months more to Roosevelt ? ? And that will be the end of moonshine ? ? Look out now Son Martin ? You better watch your whiskey still ? ? ?Cause if you?re gonna keep it you?ll have to shoot to kill ? ? The boy that?s standin? by your side ? ? Is about your only friend ? Look out now Son Martin again ? ? Frank is out there lookin? he?s searchin? everywhere ? ? With him is the doctor who came to get his share ? ? They?re shootin? up your neighbors ? ? They?re trying to scare you Son ? ? They wanna take your moonshine and put you on the run ? ? Look out now Son Martin ? You better watch your whiskey still ? ? ?Cause if you?re gonna keep it you?ll have to shoot to kill ? ? The boy that?s standin? by your side ? ? Is about your only friend ? Look out now Son Martin again ? ? The boy that?s standin? by your side ? ? Is about your only friend ? Look out now Son Martin again ? We have nice rooms for $2. Three dollars includes breakfast and supper. Just a room. Will you be with us for a while? Ain?t sure. Depends. Lowell? Take Mr. Long here up to room 205, please. If there?s anythi?? you?d be needin?.. Not right now. God, mister. I?ve carried some heavy ?uns. We get a lot of salesmans here. Railroad people. Lumber buyers. I reckon this here suitcase is about the heaviest one there. - Here, I?ll take that. - No, I-- No, no, I?ll take that. Don?t worry. Well, tell me something. The, uh, the little lady downstairs her husband, uh, work in the hotel too? - Miss Simpson? - ?Yeah.? She ain?t got no husband. She, uh, did one time back, I reckon. ?Married to a salesman, I believe he was.? He lived in Louisville till he got runned over with a car and died from it. Now she?s right back here in Marlette. She lives right here in the hotel? Oh, no, sir, she lives out with some kin, uh, a Worthman. Got yourself a real nice front view here iffen you like to look out of the window. Can I get you anythin? else? Well, what do you have in mind? Well, a lot of times, these gentlemen come in here and they wonder if I can, uh, get ?em somethin? to drink. Oh, yeah? You talkin? about liquor or, uh, soda pop? Well, they tell me the two of ?em go together pretty good. Yeah, they sure do. Iffen you like, I could may be run down the street here and, uh-- No, thank you, good boy. - Uh.. - You know what that is for? Well, it looks like a BAR rifle to me. That?s what it is. You got any idea what I use it for? - ?No, sir, I sure don?t.? - Well, I?ll tell ya. I use this for huntin? moonshiners and bootleggers and anybody else that, uh, indulges in the illegal sale and drinkin? of liquor. - You understand me, boy? - Yes, sir, I sure do. ?Yeah.? Well, if there ain?t nothin? else you want? - Not right now. - Okay. Bathroom?s right down the hall. (male #1) That?s why it tastes so damn good. (male #2) What? (male #1) Well, Son, he don?t go puttin? a lot of devilment in this mash just to hurry up the fermentin?. Just like his daddy. You didn?t want to go hurryin? him none. You waited till he said it was ready and by God, you drunk clear bust head. Some people asked for ya. If they ain?t talkin? about closed-down mines and tidy-ass Herbert Hoover it?s about old man Martin?s whiskey?s like none of us ever made any. Hey, Son. Thought you had a light in this place. Just a minute. Jesus Christ. Got a, a light in the barn, a light in the still in there. He?s got one in the crapper. [laughter] So as he can read. Son, I don?t mean to sit around here all night passin? wind with these here punkin? rollers. So I?m fixin? to take a couple of gallon of your good old shine and pay you, um.. ...$5 confiscation price. How do you feel about that? (Frank) I?m lookin? for John W. Son Martin. Am I at the right place ?or I have interrupted a prayer meetin??? Well, I figured you?d show up here one of these days. Hey, you recognize my voice. Son, I don?t reckon I ever met up with your friend. That?s Frank Long, Mr. Baylor. Well, now, Mr. Long. Whereabouts are you from? All over the state, you might say. I might not. I?m asking you where are you from? Uh, more recently, uh, I guess, Louisville. Oh. Well, they say it?s a pretty place. Well, I can?t say myself ?cause I ain?t never been there. Frank Long, uh, what-what do you do in Louisville? I work for the government. Mm-hm. That means state government? Oh, no, sir. The United States federal government. I see. Mr. Frank Long, uh are you by any chance a prohibition agent? Well, that?s pretty good, Mr. Baylor. - Uh, you got keen eyes. - Keen nose, too, I reckon. Let me see your credentials. Well, they, uh, they gave me this here uh, identification card uh, with my picture on it. And they gave me, uh, this here to stop a man in his tracks ?and set him back five paces.? Boy, are you threatenin? somebody? Well, you asked for my credentials. Well, I see ?em. You can see my credentials up there, too sittin? against the porch wall. High-power rifles and shotguns. Iffen the law needs upholdin? in these parts, Mr. Frank Long I uphold it. I take care of it. You all, uh, confiscating whiskey, Mr. Baylor? Well, I reckon you might say so. A swig at a time. Royce, give Mr. Long boy a sample our white light, will ya? [indistinct singing] Uh, right good stuff, huh, Mr. Long, hmm? Oh, it?d be cryin? shame to throw that out in the ground just because some titless old women figure a feller oughtn?t to drink that, wouldn?t it? I?m asking now, wouldn?t it? Uh, Mr. Baylor, just ?cause a man?s paid to uphold the law don?t mean to say he can?t appreciate the finer things of life. Well...have yourself another little drink, Mr. Long. Frank didn?t come here to drink no whiskey. Oh, I think it?s time I went to the house and had ourselves a little talk. (Baylor) ?Mr. Long, if you come here? ?as an old friend of Son?s, we are right glad to have ya.? ?But iffen you come on business..? Well, a revenuer is a rare bird around these here parts. I mean, i-it?s so rare that an old boy who?s likely to see him, uh, you know what he?s liable to do? Well, he?s liable to shoot that rare bird ?and, and take him on down to Louisville and have him stuffed? bring him back here and put him over his fireplace or maybe hang him over there in the corn crib along with the other skunk tails. Oh, listen, as a federal officer I have the right to order you to back me up. Yeah. You better get right on down the road now while the gettin? is good. You go back on where you come from while you?re still a sound body and can breathe fresh air. Now, go on. Git! I?ll be seein? you again, Mr. Baylor. (Baylor) ?Yeah?? [Baylor laughs] Mm-hmm, unless I?m lucky and pass away in my sleep. I?ll be seein? you, too, Son. Well, goddamn it, I said it started to rain. Rained like it never rained around here before. It washed away timber and crops and houses that had stood for a hundred years. And, worse than that, it washed plumb away the top soil. Now, ya can?t grow a market crop on sandstone. No. A-a-and so you got to set up makin? stills. Why, half the families around here if they didn?t have stills, they?d go hungry. Yeah, I ain?t interested in any washed-up outfits. Well, Mr. Frank Long, you have come to the wrong county. Ain?t no big-time operators around here. How ?bout 150 barrels of prime corn run and stored away? Oh, ho, ho, ho. That old story. - Yeah. - Well, it?s hell?s bells. Some folks around here believe anythin?. Anybody around here?d tell you that that Son and his daddy made their livin? diggin? coal. Why, the old man hisself got, got killed in a cave-in. Oh, they may have dug coal for the potato and some bread but they were countin? on the whiskey for the big casino. A hundred and fifty barrels run and stored away to age. That?s 4500 gallons. Why wouldn?t they sell the stuff? Five bucks a gallon that?s 22,500. Right. And he bootlegger. He?d get himself 122,000, couldn?t he, right? Not if I capture it. ?Cause if I capture it, I?ll pour it on the ground and the figure comes to zero. Oh, I suppose you?d like to do somethin? like that now, wouldn?t you? Oh, it ain?t gonna bother me none. [Baylor sighs] ?Now, supposin?? ?they did put away a little whiskey.? ?No future in the mines? ?and in the farm, they can?t grow a crop? no more than rocks and weeds. But maybe there is a way iffen they got the guts and the muscle and the willpower to do it. And if they don?t mind breaking the law. W-what about a man?s right? Man?s got a right to eat his corn and he?s got a right to drink it or wash his rear end with it if he wants to. I don?t know. Quite a pretty little lady there.. Are you listenin? to anything I?ve been tellin? to you? Excuse, mister, I gotta go and do me some work. Oh, what is this gonna get you, anyway? $5 raise in salary? Or, you be such sweet boy, they maybe give you a promotion? Ah. [sighs] Then I heard him. He knows how much you got and all ?bout it. I think he?s trying to get Mr. Baylor to help him. Come on. Now, you know better than that. - Son, he is a federal agent. - Oh. Hey! Somebody?s gonna see us. - Oh, everyone?s workin?. - Well, somebody going by. - Mm. - Ah. - Sweetheart. - Mm. - Ah. - I hear you. - The sun?s in my eyes. - Close ?em. [gasps] [chuckles] And I?m gettin? stone bruise on my ass. [John Kay singing "Moonshine Friend Of Mine"] ? Moonshine Tennessee wine ? Runnin? around my head ? Moonshine friend of mine ? Help me to find my bed ? I said I?d never go to town again yeah ? ? But here I go I?m paintin? it red ? ? Forgettin? all the easy words I said ? ? Now I?m walkin? out the door ? I just got to get some more of that ? ? Moonshine Tennessee wine ? Runnin? around my head ? Moonshine friend of mine ? Yeah help me to find my bed ? Hey, what?s there on the back your leg? - What? - Like a birthmark. Never noticed it before. Well, usually, when I?m with you, I?m facin? the other way. Oh. (male #3) ?When that cap falls, that means the mash is ready to run.? Put your ear down close on the barrel. Listen, it sound like me to cry. Ah, lay that shotgun down. You lookin? for something, mister? Hey, boy, you?re pointin? that thing at me. No, it just a-pointin? where you happen to be a-standin?. Come on, lay it down! Damn, I?d sure like to but my finger kind of catched up in this trigger and I?m scared to move it. I?m gonna shoot you right between your eyes, nigger. Do you wanna get shot? No, ?cause this old shotgun about to go up and blow them mash barrels all to hell and anything close to ?em. Okay. You can hang onto that. I?m goin? to be seeing you again, huh?

[laughing] You hear me out there, mister? We see your face around here again we?re gonna take and throw you all the way out the window. ?Nod yes iffen you can hear me.? I?m not foolin? either. You think I?m foolin?? Alright, you stay there till we tell you you can come in. [indistinct chatter] [man whistling] [men laughing] - Oh. - Come on, kiddo. [indistinct chatter] Gimme a nickel. Okay. Well, git! Operator, I wanna place a collect call to Louisville. Party by the name of Dr. Emmett Taulbee. I don?t see him around. Well, guess he ain?t. We?re a little early though.

Get you a nice Coca-Cola. - Hi, doe. - How are you folks today? We?re hungry, miss. That?s pretty much what we are. Well, you sure have come to the right place. Well, I sure hope so. My goodness, it?s a hot one, ain?t it? Oh. You folks on a vacation trip or somethin?? Now how?d you know that? Oh, them travelin? folks come in here all the time. - I can always tell. - Yeah, sure. Well, I want a Coca-Cola before I die of thirst. What are you gonna have, doctor? Sure enough, you a doctor? Oh, not that kind, miss. I?m a dental physician, now retired. Golly, that must be awful nice. Do you just travel around all the time? That?s right. Just travel around. My, we do see some sights, don?t we, Dual? We sure do.

Mm, I sure like a suit like that. Really like a suit like that. Mm-mmm. I like that suit. It ain?t all woolly and hot like this one. What, what do you pay for a suit like that? Uh, this suit? Uh.. Why, I think 50 bucks. Forty-four. Don?t you remember you were wonderin? if you should spend that much on it? Uh, would you mind standin? up and, uh, let me take a look at that suit? Please? Hmm, that?s the prettiest suit that I have ever seen. You can be proud of that suit forever. Doc, ain?t that the prettiest suit you?ve ever seen in your life? - That?s a pretty suit. - Yeah. Yes, it is. That is a pretty suit. Hm. Uh.. I tell you what? I?ll buy it off of ya. Well, gee, if I had another, I?d sell it. I-I don?t want no other. I want that one.

Mister, you better get out of them drawers. That?s a good boy. They don?t have enough mayonnaise on my salad. You, uh, you like that dress she?s wearin?? - Who? - Who? Her. It?s alright, but I don?t wear much brown. (Emmett) ?Well, it might look good on you.? I don?t know. I think it?s too small. No, I don?t think so. Dual? We?ll take that dress too. Oh.

(Emmett) ?Howdy, Frank? How you doin??? If you mind tellin? me how come those two people just went out of here without any clothes on? (Emmett) Well, it was the damnedest thing. There was a couple of nudists runnin? around in here. The waitress had to throw ?em out. - Nudists? - ?Yeah.? Whose clothes are these? Now, Frank. We drove over 200 miles to meet with ya. You wanna talk about nudists or whiskey? I never met a prohibition man yet I trust. That?s good, Dual. That?s very good. You remember to say that three times every night before you go to bed. Do you hear me? I?ve got no time to play games, Taulbee. We?re gonna talk or not? [laughs] Hey, come on, we?re just funnin? you. Come on, sit down. Tell us about this deal ya got. Come on, sit down. [laughs] ?Oh.? Ah, over there across the stream and the trees that?s where the still?s at. Moonshine could be anywhere under the house, for all I know. Oh, might as well introduce these people and get right to it, Son, seein? as how you?re so busy. This here is, uh, Dr. Taulbee. ?He used to be a dentist, now a scientific whiskey exper?? come here to taste your daddy?s stuff for the government, see if it?s any good. Uh, little lady is Miss Miley, uh, Mitchell uh, doctor?s assistant. And over here, we have Mr. Dual Metters uh, come as a special investigator to help us capture the stuff in case you force us to take it that way. Uh, folks, this here?s Son Martin, my old army buddy. Well, Son, uh, even though you?re breakin? the law we?ve given a lotta consideration to the fact the amount of work you put in to runnin? 150 barrels and we?ve come up with a proposition we guarantee is gonna interest you. My goodness. It?s gettin? warm, ain?t it? Uh, Mr. Martin, wonder if you?d have a cold drink of water in the house. Oh. Oh, yeah. Could you let me have a cup then? Cup?s on the pump, ain?t it? Cup?s on the pump? Oh, yeah. Sure does. Miley, be a good girl and fetch your doctor a nice cup of spring water if you please. Oh, uh, Son, you just, uh listen to it first, huh, and then decide. Hey, I can?t get this dumb thing to work! Alright, Miley, just forget it. Why don?t we just go in the house and sit down and, uh, we explain the whole thing to you, huh? Miley?d be real tickled to make us up a pot of coffee. ?Alright?? Come on, lovely pet! - Well? - Frank. Well, Son, uh.. ..how?d it be if, uh, we was to offer to.. ...to buy the whiskey off ya? I?d say yous bootleggers. Doo, hoo-hoo! My goodness, if the folks in Louisville could hear you say that. No, what Frank means is if we bought it on behalf of the government? Well, I didn?t know the government was in the business. Well, not in the business, uh, per se, so to say but there is such a thing as government spirits. ?Didn?t you know that? Oh, yeah, for medicinal use and so on.? A-all you got to do is give us a sample. Well, you buy it and you can sample all you want. Why, the government ain?t that dumb. I mean, they ain?t gonna buy it unless, uh unless Dr. Taulbee says it tastes good. Then they ain?t gonna buy it. Now, who do you think you?re foolin?, Son? You-you?re dealin? with the United States federal government. Or a couple of dudes tryin? to put somethin? over on a poor dumb hillbilly. Uh, Son.. ...I?d, uh, I?d like you to tell me somethin?. How much you want for your whiskey? Twenty-seven thousand dollars. Who?s gonna pay $27,000 for 150 pounds of moonshine? (Emmett) Now, just a second, just a second. The man says that?s his price. That?s his prerogative. But, uh, I was just thinkin?.. ...if the government won?t pay your price.. ...what would you say if I bought it as a private citizen? I?d say yous a bootlegger for sure. Or a speculator, huh? What would you say if I bought it and left it ?right wherever it?s at, gamblin? unrepealed?? If the country stays dry, I lose my shirt. But if Roosevelt gets elected and the 18th is repealed I buy tax stamps and market the booze before the big distillers can get started again. Well, I?ll admit, it?s, uh it?s a chancy proposition, alright? But, uh, I might be willin? to take the gamble. As a matter of fact.. ..I?ll give you $4500 for the whole load right now ?a dollar a gallon.? Frank, why don?t you and your pussyfoot scientific whiskey expert get the hell off of my property? You get fresh, buddy, and I?ll-I?ll-I?ll nail you to the wall and all your goddamn scrub farm apart. I sure would like to see you do that, Frank. Why don?t y?all go on outside and let me take care of this boy? Well, you so much as even twitch and I shoot the knot off?n your red tie. You can?t get all three of us. I bet you a dollar I can. [chuckles] Well, I guess the talkin? part?s over, ain?t it? You are makin? a mistake, Sonny. And I can?t help but feel you know it. I also feel that in time you?re gonna wanna change your mind and accept our offer. - Ain?t that right, Frank? - He?d better. So, we?re gonna give you time. One day. You don?t come to us by tomorrow we ain?t gonna buy your whiskey, we?ll just take it. That?s all. Come on, sweet thing. Coffee?s almost ready. Uh, just a minute. You want my answer now? Friend, that?s up to you. Be seein? ya. - How do? - ?May I help ya?? Yes, ma?am, you sure may. But first, we?ll have some nice rooms. - Yes, sir. - Yes, ma?am. I think, uh, the little lady and me we?ll have the bridal suite. - Bridal suite? - Mm-hmm. And, uh, somethin? nearby for my boy here. - Yes, sir. - Thank ya. [bell dings] Lowell. - Just a sec. - You just take your time. Lowell? Where are you, Lowell? Say, Frank. She?s alright, ain?t she? - Miss Simpson. - Miss Simpson, huh? Yes, sir, she is alrighty. What would you do with two women? Same thing I do with one. Ain?t she enough for ya? Well, if you mean by enough, all I want, sure. Little old Miley can dish up the poontang. But she is one woman and that one there is another. Lowell, I?m waitin?. And, mister, they are all different. Each one has her own little pleasures and secret tender places. - Just thought of somethin?. - Yes, sir. She?s alright. Lowell here?ll get your bags. Thank you, ma?am. What?s that? I just thought of somebody who?d know where the whiskey?s at. - Yeah, who?s that? - Son?s hired help, uh, Aaron. Used to work for the old man. When they, when they run the whiskey. Oh, yeah. Boy with the shotgun. - Nigger. - Yeah. Well, it shouldn?t be too hard to git it out of him. And I never met one yet who didn?t wanna talk. Yeah, that?s a true thing. Thank you, Miss Simpson. Thank you very kindly. Sugar dear, get away from the.. [banging] Dual boy, don?t do that. You?re gonna break it. Now, get on up here. Come on. Make a sound and you?re a dead nigger. Put on your shoesies. We?re goin? out. [dramatic music] (Emmett) Evenin?. Good to see ya again. Now, then, boy. We don?t want but one thing out of you. Where?s that whiskey? I can?t tell you somethin? I don?t know. (Emmett) ?Is that so?? Alright. Frank, give old Dual here a hand if you please. Take him up. [chicken clucking] Why don?t you tie his hand? I like to see their arms a-flappin?. That?s enough. Drop him. [chicken clucking] Alright, boy. Now, you gonna tell us? I said now?re you gonna tell us? Take him up again. Hey, maybe he doesn?t know. Son coulda hid the stuff while he wasn?t around. (Dual) He knows alright. He?s just lyin? is all. Hey, wait a minute. All we got to do, tell Son he don?t give us the whiskey, we?ll hang his boy. - Yeah, and then what? - He hands over the stuff. Who cares? He just goes and gets himself another nigger. [scoffs] Dual, you are a caution. ?Good thinkin?, Frank, that?s just what we?re gonna do.? Now, let?s see, uh.. (Dual) ?Open both doors so I can see him real good.? [Emmett softly] ?Go do it, Frank. Loud and clear.? Son! Son Martin! Can you hear me? We got your boy! Take a look over in the barn! ?You got 30 seconds!? ?Tell us where your whiskey?s at or we give him a push!? ?Do ya hear me?? ?Come out!? ?You got four seconds.? ?One!? ?Two!? ?Three!? [dramatic music] [gunshot] (Emmett) There he is! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Oh, damn. - Ooh! - You alright, Dual boy? (Dual) ?I-I guess so.? Doc, l-l-look at my suit. Ooh, my, my, that?s mean. What a shame. What a shame. Well, we?ll get ya a new one. Yes, sir. Frank, looks like that boy?s got some gristle in him. Looks like he?s gonna make us go to work. Come on, let?s get outta here. Come on. ?Comin?, Frank?? - Federal boys? - Well, that?s the thing. I don?t know what they are, but they ain?t no federal agents. They come here armed. Pretty nice strung up there in the barn. ?Now, I think these boys are goin? to try? to get everything they can. If they don?t have enough guns for the job well, just go out and get some more. Well, what is it they want, Son? My whiskey to start with. And you want us to stick our ass out and protect it? We got us a few troubles of our own, Son just a-feedin? our families. Mr. Worthman, I think you?re gonna have some more problems if we don?t bunch up here. Put a stop to these boys right now. Well, threatenin? and doin? is two different things, Son. You run ?em off once, didn?t ya? Well, not for good, I know that. If we don?t chase them then some of us liable to end up just plumb foot under. Well, what I?d like to know is why you called us here, Son? I mean, since all they want is your whiskey. [scoffs] Well, that?s all anybody?s gotta say, huh? You?re wantin? us to fight ?em. They ain?t comin? lookin? for nothin? of ours. I say you should talk it over with ?em. Feel them out more before you reach any set notions. Well, I sure appreciate that, Mr. Worthman. [instrumental music] (Dual) Howdy, Boyd? How do, Boyd? How you doin?? Uh, just fine, Dr. Taulbee. Well, you?re lookin? real good, Boyd. Frank, this here is, uh, Boyd Caswell. Me and him, uh, we cellmates at Eddyville. The way ol? Boyd drinks why, he knows where every still in the county?s at. - Don?t ya? - Right. Hey, you got some moonshine in the house, huh? Who?s that? Well, uh, he?s a prohibition fella, Boyd but you don?t need to worry about him. He?s on our side. Let?s have some of that shine. My, he?s a real beaut. Come on, sugar kid. You, too, Frank. Boyd won?t tell on ya. Boyd? Get out the fruit jars. They?re here. ?Howdy, boys.? (Dual) ?Hey, how ya doin??? - ?Hey, how ya doin??? - How ya doin? there, Moose? Uh, these fellows are gunmen? You bet they are. Gotta have them to do the job. Well, federal agents is how they?re supposed to look. Well, they don?t look so bad. - ?Hey, you brought ?em, huh?? - Brung you a present, Dual. - Oh, much obliged. - Good to see you boys again. - Nice to be here. - Much obliged. This here?s Frank Long who?s promisin? all the fun and prizes. Maybe some of ya know him. That?s the man sent me to Eddyville. Yeah, and you?re goin? right back there if you start makin? that noise with that thing and shootin? people. - Hey, Taulbee? - Huh? If my office gets to hear about this, it?s all over. Lord, don?t I know that. And no shootin? unless they start it. - No shootin? to kill. - No, sir. No, sir. - Boy, got the corn out? - Yeah. Come on, boys. Get inside, out of the sun. - Come on, let?s get in. - Come on. - ?Hi, Fred.? - Hi there, Miley. (Miley) Hey. Hey, Joe, is that you I see? - ?Howdy, Miley? How are you?? - I?m fine. Haven?t seen you boys in a coon day. - ?Hi, Miley.? - ?Hi.? We play it right, we can pull it. But if they start a shoot-up-- Now, Frank, uh what-what?s this pullin? we got to do? All we need to do is trust each other lead a clean life, we shall have our reward. Now, let?s go on in there and tell the boys what you got in mind. (Miley) ?Hey, here comes Long.? [laughter] We?re gonna have trouble with that boy. How come? He?s startin? to eat his own insides. - He is? - He?s startin? to make rules. What do we need rules for? We do think alike, don?t we? [laughing] Why, he?s pullin? their teeth. Three different women accused him. [laughs] He gave them gas to put them out and then assaulted them right there in the dentist?s chair. God Almighty, a girl could come in with a toothache and walk out knocked up. [laughs] He spent three years in prison and after that was arrested twice for bootleggin?. - God. - That other one, Dual. He was in prison for attempted murder. Well, now they are convicts. Well, go tell Bud Blackwell and your Cousin Burgell. They wouldn?t listen to me. Oh, you want some coffee or somethin?? - What are you gonna do? - I don?t know. Not much you can do but wait. I don?t like the sound of that BAR. Oh, hell, how can he shoot me and still hope to find the whiskey? But they could. They could kill ya and spend their good ol? time lookin? for it. I don?t know. They say they will make a deal, but I don?t know about it. They offered to buy the whiskey? Dollar a gallon. You call that offer? Maybe they?ll go higher than that. Did you ask ?em? I don?t do business with them people. But you have to. They ain?t gonna go away just because ya say no. Well, we waited this long. Anyway, election?s in two months. - Suppose Roosevelt don?t win? - Oh, he?s gotta win. You think people gonna let things get worser than they already are? You still can?t be sure prohibition is gonna be repealed. Well, then I sell the whiskey, anyways but not to them people. You?re breakin? the law anyhow. Now, what?s the difference? I see the difference. What surprises me is you don?t. Come on. McClendon? This here is the law. Come on, get out of the way. Come on, get! [gunshots] I want you to tell Son Martin somethin? for me. Tell him I commenced burstin? stills. I am going to go on burstin? ?em till he hands over his whiskey. ?You just spread the word, mister? ?you and your moonshinin? neighbors.? You go and have a talk to Son Martin! [gunshots] Worthman, where?s your still at? What still are you talkin? about? Hey, you? Over here. Come on over. - Me? - Come on. Get over! I mean the still you moved from where it used to be. Oh, that still. That one?s in the barn. We need our still. We need it, mister. Now, Mr. Worthman, if Son Martin was cooperatin? the way you?re doin? right now we wouldn?t have to bother you at all. [gunshots] [instrumental music] Boy, I sure am glad you don?t have to go out shootin? with ?em. Nope. It ain?t my mile over, sweet thing. I hate bein? alone at night more than anythin?. Well, you ain?t alone now, you sweet little sugar cake. Oh, I sure ain?t. You want a soda pop? - You don?t want? - Got mine. [engine rumbling] Good mornin?, sir. Place open yet? Where you takin? this corn meal? That ain?t corn, mister. It?s clover seed. Now, boy, I ask you where you?s taking it? I?m deliverin? this up to the Blackwell place. A little corn to make moonshine, huh? No, sir. It-it?s clover seed. We?ll just see about that. [gunshots] Well, what do you know? It is clover seed. Boyd? You know where the Blackwells live? Now, you know Frank said we?s supposed to wait a day or two before hittin? the Blackwells. Why is nobody answerin? my questions this mornin?? Okay, I know where he lives. Well, come on then. We?ll get us another one before breakfast. [John Kay singing "Moonshine Friend Of Mine"] ? Moonshine Tennessee wine ? Runnin? around my head ? Moonshine friend of mine ? Help me to find my bed ? Moonshine Tennessee wine ? Runnin? around my head ? Moonshine friend of mine ? Yeah help me to find my bed ? Better get outta the way, friend. [gunshots] [groans] Oh, goddamn, Boyd. Go ahead and call the boy?s folks if you want to. I just ain?t got time runnin? around arrestin? everybody for stealin? a comb or a keychain. [laughs] Hey, you know what you oughta do is go on home and get your wife to take some of that Mentholatum and rub it down your chest. (Baylor) ?Well, now Mr. Frank Long.? They tell me that you?ve been raidin? puttin? a lot of good fellas out of business. I?m gonna lay it right in front of you, Mr. Baylor. If ya want this thing to end you better go have a talk to Son Martin. I think maybe I better have a little talk with Covington. See if they sent a fellow named Mr. Frank Long here. You got that number, Royce? You want the number, I?ll give it to ya. You wanna call Covington, ask about me, you go right ahead. You tell ?em I raided three stills last night and bust the hell out of ?em. Tell ?em what he was doin? too. What were you doin?, lyin? home at bed or out drinkin? whiskey? I don?t recollect you asking for my help. I didn?t get none either. County sheriff?s supposed to uphold the law. All I get?s a hard-luck story about the poor moonshiners and the worn-out farms. You best start the call on what you said. ?Cause more than three people are gonna be out of business if he don?t hand it over. You askin? for my help now? I ain?t askin? for anything! I?m tellin? you! I?m telling you to tell Son Martin to face the facts of life, and by life, I mean a couple of people could get killed ?round here before we?re through. Where are you going? I ain?t finished talkin? to you yet. I?d like to go on home, crawl into bed and pull the covers up and sleep until Sunday but instead I gotta go out and see about a shootin?. Shootin?? You tell me you raided three places last night including the Blackwells? Oh, oh, Blackwell is next unless you talk to Son. Well, that is funny because somebody just hit Blackwell?s still and they shot an old boy named Boyd Caswell. - Is he dead? - No, not yet he ain?t. Royce, uh, you lock up after Mr. Frank Long and then when we get back, you remind me to call Covington ?unless?n Mr. Frank Long still wants to give us that number.? Ah, not a bad haul. Ain?t what we come for though, is it, Dual boy? No, it ain?t, doc. (Emmett) Oh, sir, there?s the old revenuer. - Anybody get hurt? - Uh, one boy got hit. Mm-hmm. Well, don?t say nothin? in front of him. Howdy, Frank? Now, we got some talkin? to do. Well, speak up. Don?t be bashful. I thought I said we was only to raid three stills and then wait. Somethin? I ain?t been told? He hit Blackwell?s this mornin?. Well, they done the job, didn?t they? Yeah, you seen Boyd Caswell around? What?s he talkin? about? Well, you asked me if anybody?s hit? - Yes. - Well, Boyd got shot. - Well, where is he now? - Well, I?m not sure exactly. - Ya left him? - Well-- Jesus, of all people, you left Boyd Caswell. We didn?t leave him, he just didn?t make it back to the car is all. Well, I warned you, Taulbee, any unnecessary shootin? and we blow the whole thing. Well, Frank, I-I-I?m real sorry about this. I don?t wanna get you messed up in it. So, why don?t you just go back to the hotel? - I?ll meet you there later. - Alright, you?ll fix it? I?ll fix everything. Don?t worry about a thing, Frank. - You take care of him too. - I?ll take care of everything. You lock him up. He?s a lunatic. He ain?t fit to be let.. Well, he-he ain?t a lunatic. Well, you lock him up, I?m tellin? ya. [indistinct shouting] (Emmett) He?s lovable, you know. Bye. You remember now, damn it, Taulbee. Lock him up! Dual.. ...one time years ago, you climbed up on a garage and dropped a rock on a boy?s head, didn?t ya? That fat son of a bitch, he was always pickin? on me. That big fat son of a bitch caused you to run away from home didn?t he? ?If you hadn?t though..? Then I wouldn?t have gone to jail. And you wouldn?t have met Boyd Caswell, would you? That?s right, at, uh, Eddyville. And if you hadn?t been at Eddyville.. Then I wouldn?t have thought of him to help us. And if you hadn?t thought of him.. ...he wouldn?t be out at Blackwell?s right now, would he? Probably sittin? up in bed tellin? ?em we ain?t federal folks at all. Just some old boys from Louisville. - Well, I guess you?re right. - You?re damn right I?m right! Well, look, I better get a couple cars and go on-- Wait a minute. This time I?m comin? with ya. You know, the funny part is Boyd here says that they ain?t federals at all. Now, as soon as I get him on downtown I?m going to find out who your friend really is. Well, now what do you plan to do with Boyd? We?re going to take him to the doctor?s. What in the hell do you think I?m goin? to do? You just wait a minute. You just wait one minute-- Why don?t you get out of our way or I take you in with him? Just get inside! [indistinct chatter] [Boyd groans] [engine starts] Son, they ain?t hit you, have they? Sure am sorry about all that, Mr. Worthman. Oh, yeah. Well, you sure as hell don?t look sorry, I tell ya. Son, neighbors look to help each other not cause pain and hardship. You?re the one that made that big run, that?s all they want. Son, you ain?t got no family. That?s the difference. Yeah. Alright, Mr. Worthman, I?ll help you build a new outfit and I?ll help you hide it. Now, if you don?t want me to do that, then I, I?ll just go on leave, and you can do whatever you want. Son, right neighborly of ya. [instrumental music] [car honking] [tires screeching] How do? What in the hell do you think you?re doin?? Iffen you can read, shorty my badge says Sheriff, Broke Leg County. He?s in there alright, doc. Are you gonna get your cars the hell outta my way? ?I?ve got a sick prisoner here. I gotta get him to a doctor.? He ain?t gonna make it. Are you gonna get them cars out of my way or not? I?ll tell you what, papa. You give him to us, we?ll take care of him. I?m a-tellin? you for one last time. You?re right about that last time, papa. [gunshots] Somebody else gonna have to finish off Boyd. I?m empty. [gunshots] Dump it. Thank you, ma?am. Hey, uh, will you let me have a half dozen boxes of .30-06s and-and give me all the 00 12-gauge shells you got in the store? You?re gonna pay cash? Well.. You know when I pay. Put it on my bill. I?m afraid I can?t do that. Why not? Well, boss says you gotta pay that $260 you owe before you can charge any more. Hey, Willie, how long has my family been comin? in this store? I don?t know. Don?t keep track of all-- Thirty years we been payin? our bills. [sighs] Well, I?m sorry. It?s a new policy. Since when is that? Look, we gotta pay our bills too. Since when is that a new policy? Since this mornin?. - Afternoon, Son. - Where is Miss Simpson at? Well, she just stepped around back for a minute. Lizzy, I need $200 fast as you can get it. For what? For things I need to stay alive. All of a sudden, I ain?t got no more credit. I?ve been to the feed store, the bank-- It don?t take long, does it, for word to get ?round? We should start tellin? people you have to have everything your own way. If I don?t have this my way, then we don?t have it. We could end this whole thing right now. Sure, all I got to do is give ?em the whiskey. No, you sell it to ?em and let?s leave this place. Son, you do that and I?ll give you everything I have. Leave and go where? Well, I don?t know. Anywhere. No, now come on, Lizzy. Where we gonna go? Go down to Georgia and pick cotton for three dollars a week? Or go on up to Detroit like your brother and get a job in a factory, try to make a lotta money and wind up standin? on a bread line? Look, we said we was goin? to wait for repeal. That?s what we?re gonna do. You have to have everything your own way. All we?re talkin? about. No, I have to have $200, that?s what we?re talking about. I ain?t gonna pay to see ya killed. [instrumental music] ? Ere we reach the shining river ? ? Lay we every burden down ? Grace our spirits will deliver ? ? And provide a robe and crown ? Yes we will gather at the river ? ? The beautiful the beautiful river ? ? Gather with the saints ? Hey, tell the truth. He send you? Don?t say anything dumb. Okay? Well, if he didn?t send you, what ya doin? here? I don?t know. I guess I wanted to see what you were like. Hey, you go with that woman from the hotel? Well, I guess I did. She ain?t your type. You married to him, Taulbee? You?re sweet. You like him? Not really my type, but it could be worse. What the hell you?re living with him for? Haven?t had any better offers. Look, if something was to happen to Taulbee, what would you do? I don?t know. Go back to workin? in a house, I guess. Nice part, there was always somebody to talk to. Even when there wasn?t any customers. Like in the afternoon, we?d sit around talkin? and fixin? each other?s hair. Sometimes I and another girl?d go shoppin? and have a lunch out. I can?t stand sittin? around all by myself. Just really ain?t in the mood, are ya? Don?t worry about it. Will you explain somethin? to me? How come you don?t run while you have the chance? I don?t know. Come on. [explosion] Well, it?s old, but it?s still alive. I?d say, that?d do the job. [dramatic music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [knocks] Hey, doctor. He?s here again. Well, sir. Here?s old Frank. We had a good thing goin?. Now, it?s all over. Aww, I reckon he heard. Heard? Heard? They?re parading the bodies up and down Main Street. Is that a fact? I didn?t think anybody?d find ?em for a couple of days. Mm. Well, we just have to move along a little faster, that?s all. Now, listen, listen, I?m tellin? ya. It?s, i-it?s all over! We don?t get out of here now, we?re done. Well, Frank.. ...I guess your part is done. But, uh, me and old Dual we gotta find us that whiskey yet. Yeah? Well, uh.. Huh? I?m telling you, I?m gonna shoot ya first! (Emmett) ?Now, don?t get gaudy.? ?It?s time for you to go home is all.? You?re through here, boy. We don?t need ya no more. Think I?m just gonna walk outta here? That?s about it. You took a chance and didn?t make it. But, hell, you?re still alive, ain?t ya? Old Dual there, he?s for puttin? you under. But I said to him, "Hell! "Frank, he ain?t gonna tell on us. "He knows if we go to jail, he?ll go right along with us hopin? and prayin? some accident don?t befall him." Ain?t that right, Frank, huh? Just a minute. You mean to say I ain?t.. ...I ain?t going to get nothin? out of this? That?s what I?m sayin?. I was the one that brought ya in. And I?m most grateful to you. You mean, I?m just gonna walk outta here with my hands in my pockets? That?s just about it. [chuckles] Hey, you know, Frank, boy you ain?t as dumb as I thought. Get in the car and put that down. And get in the car. Move it. Come on. [banging] In the car. Move it. Anh-anh! Bless your little heart and the best of luck to you, Frank. [engine starts] Whoa! Got a little old moonshine for ya. You?ll be needin? it. Oh, my, how you?ll be needin? it. [laughs] [knock on door] Who is it? [mumbles] (Lizzy) ?Can I talk to ya?? Lady, I got nothin? to talk about. I?m retired. - You mean you?re leavin?? - Hey, you guessed it. I?m goin? back to Louisville, or the army. Yeah. Why not the army? I forgot how easy it was. - You?re just quittin?? - Mm-hmm. If you help Son.. ...I?ll pay ya for it. Help my old buddy, huh? How dumb do you think I am? Risk my neck for your boyfriend? How much? About $800. [mumbles] Eight.. [mumbling] What will ya take? I guess ya got some secret treasures buried down there. I could jump on your bones right now still go home in the morni?? without helpin? anybody. Only trouble is I ain?t in the mood for romance right now. Hey, just a minute. Here! Look at me! Only people who can help Son now are his friends. ?Only, he don?t have one.? Am I right? [dramatic music] [car approaching] (Aaron) I hear cars comin?. (Son) Yeah, damn, that?s quicker than I figured. Here, gimme a hand with this. Sure wish we had a couple of more boxes of ?em 00s. Well, we?ll just have to get by with what we got. (Son) Okay, I?ll see you in a spell. Man, oh, man. Now? This time, like this? [dramatic music] [music continues] Damn! Hush.

Heard everybody around here is goin? out to help Son. Well, look out in the street. You don?t see hardly no cars, do ya? Ain?t nobody around here, nohow. - Can I ride out with ya? - Hey, wait for me! Lord, I?ve been left alone enough. [engine starts] [gunshot] They still shootin? hot. Wastin? all them bullets. (Son) ?Aaron.? Look, see up there? ?Look what?s comin?.? Hey, doctor. Looks like trouble. That?s the Worthmans. It?s, it?s Blackwell, it?s.. It?s Arley Stamper up there. Now look up that hill, doc. You see what you got on your eyes. Look like some women too.

Hey.. What?s goin? on? I don?t see anybody doin? any helpin?. [gunshot] Well, ain?t you in the wrong feud, Mr. Lawman? I guess you?re all wonderin? what I?m doin? here. I?ll tell you. Them fellas I hired to help me out turned out to be nothin? but a bunch of bootleggers. They quit me ?cause I wouldn?t go along with ?em. Said they?d shoot me if I got in the way. So, I?ll tell you what I?m goin? to do. I?m gonna deputize all you men and we?re gonna drive them bootleggers all the way back to Louisville. [laughing] You with me? [gunshot] I tell ya. We gotta go down there now and help Son Martin otherwise they?re goin? to kill him. And, uh, and you?ll never find his whiskey? No, I?m talkin? about a man?s life now. Well, now, bein? as you?re so, uh, so thoughtful uh, oughtn?t you to be there with him, Mr. Long? [mumbling] He ought to be down the hill. That?s what I?m talkin? about, Virgil. Let?s just put him.. And-and you want to help Son out, now, don?t ya? Now, we, we all gotta go down there.. [clamoring] Get your butt in there! Whoo! Come on! Get in there! Get outta the way! Move! Now, you have fun.

To protect my interest. Your interest in what? I reckon you was gonna cut me into a partnership on that whiskey. He says we got us a partner. You goin? to shoot him or you want me to? Oh, come on now, boy. Don?t you talk like that. You?re gonna get your cut. I gotta protect my partnership and I got somethin? here you can do with the use of right now. US Army Browning Automatic Rifle, huh? Big sweetheart. I, I really think I oughta be leavin?. [gunshots] I own this place, you know what I?d do, Virgil? What ya do? I?d set me up a gate over there and I.. I?d charge folks to get in. That?s a hell of an idea. I mean it. I tell ya, they-they?d pay to see that old bow go down that hill again. Hey, that was good, wasn?t it? Lizzy wants us to go on down there and run them bad boys right out of that board and save old Son.. Don?t you, Lizzy, huh? You see, I tell ya. Hey, why don?t you, uh, just go on and..

I?ll tell ?em the whiskey?s buried in the cemetery. Hundred and fifty barrels, have to be a deep hole. They wouldn?t believe you. Why, I?ll tell ?em there?s mine shafts under there. And they go on over there and start diggin?. And then when they?s all bunched up together lookin? in the hole.. I open up with, with big sweetheart. (Emmett) ?One minute left, Sonny boy!? Bit of a chance though, isn?t it? You?ll be standin? out there in the open. Well, you know any better way? Son, where?s the whiskey really at? Under the barn. Under the barn?

Don?t you worry about that, buddy. Don?t you open up until I give you the word. No. (Emmett) ?Well, sir.? That?s real good thinkin?, Son. Now you just bring out Frank and your boy.
