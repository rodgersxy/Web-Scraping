The cab driver was a black guy... And he spoke to me in French or Portuguese, it was so strange. Then he asked me if I had cash to pay for the ride, and I said I didn't-- - He told me, if I sucked his dick... - What? If I sucked his dick he'd give me this, and I wouldn't have to pay for the ride. - Just like, a random cab? - Yes, he was speaking Spanish by then. - And I told him I wouldn't. - Gross, you got into the cab and-- I wasn't planning anything, the guy just came up to me like that. - He said, ''I'll give you this if--" - You're a liar, I don't believe you! Where would I get the money to buy this? That's how it went down - He saw that you were queer. - That's different, he gave it to me! I don't even want to go anywhere, things are getting awful out there. You just have to avoid Europe then. And that other place, the Middle East. Don't you remember the other day, some Arabs wanted to get into the country? - Lady, you don't say good morning now? - Come here. You don't have the same peace now, with all those armed groups. And the worst part is that this country lets anyone come in. - And they give citizenship, to anyone. -Living in the city is already risky. You go downtown, and two monkeys steal your wallet and beat you up. But what I'm saying is that they let so many foreigners come in. - What if one of them brings a bomb? - That's just terrible. - They don't have any migration control. - I think that we should move far away. To Orotina or something, at least we would have the time to run away. The problem is the airport being built there, we would have to move again. Good morning, everything OK? Aren't you in the Social Sciences class every Monday? - Yeah, Political Sciences. - Yeah! - Did you buy those copies already? - No, have you? No... They're in the Millennium photocopier, do you know where that is? - Yes. - Would you take me there? - Sure. - I'm just not familiar with the place. - It's easy, right on the main street. - Thank you. I think we need the International Politics copies. - Two anthologies, yes. - Thank you! - So, you're from Escazu? That's nice. - You must take a long time to get here. - From San Carlos or Alajuela? - No, from Alajuela. Well, it depends of the time, if you score the rush hour then... What was I saying? Oh right, how much for each copy? - How much? - Ten thousand colones. - Let's hope it lasts a lifetime. - I sure hope so. Thank you. Well, see you around then. - Of course! Do you have to go now? - Yes, I do. I was thinking that maybe you could-- It's just that I feel like we go along and I don't know anyone around here. I'm like the new guy. Would you give me your phone number so I could call you? Sure! Write it down. Just so, you know, in case I get lost or something... It's just a shame that we couldn't stay together in that-- - What's your number? - 8 8, 7 4... Maria Jose, it's such a bummer that you started attending the university. Ah, it's fine, I only have one year to go. Yeah, but this was your first day. By the way, how was it? Well, just like always, it was a bore... Oh! But check it out, a new classmate popped up. He's so nice. He is really kind, and he has this cute little eyes. - Hey now! And what did you say to him? - Nothing. What am I going to say? - Why didn't you say something? - He's very nice, he lives in Alajuela. - But his family is from San Carlos. - So what that he comes from San Carlos? You just need to flirt more, invite him for a beer or do anything, I don't know. - But that's so bold, we just met. - Maria Jose, you've never been shy. No, he is very funny. I think-- - I think he's nice, the dude. - Listen, dude... If you don't do anything with that dude, you will miss the train, man! And you're going to be here, waiting for the right guy to get off the train-- You will be all fuzzed up, looking at all the guys that pass by you. - Who wants to take this?! - I do! - Who wants to fucking take this?! - I do! 1, 2, 3 Calacas, let's go. Rugby! - Rugby! - Calacas! Let's beat the shit out of these chicks. Come here, it's ready! And we passed by the pond, climbing, and see the cousin they told us about. They're bringing her to the farm house, with a towel right here. We get closer, and the towel is dripping with blood. Turns out she took a kid's motorcycle she got as a present. But it ran on diesel, like the real thing. And she took off and she slammed against a wire. Against a wired fence with her neck, but the bike kept going... She was hanging from the wire, stuck right here, in the neck! They brought her over holding the towel and the first thing my aunt says is: "Don't let the towel fall off, don't let her see the wound!" My aunt leaves. Then my uncle gets the car, my cousin gets in, and he vanishes. Right? So, she was waiting inside the car, but the uncles are gone. Then we have to start looking for my uncle and my aunt. We find my aunt inside the bathroom of the farmhouse. Washing her hair. With shampoo. with her clothes still on. I'm serious, she was washing her hair with her clothes on. Because she was going to the hospital to get her daughter's neck sewn. My uncle was a no-show, and my aunt-- No, my cousin was left alone in the car. Holding the towel with the door open, she takes it off and looks at the wound. - I have to go now. - OK, see you later. - How will you get home? - I'll just get to the other bus stop. - What did you say? - I'll take the next bus. - Send me a text when you get there. - Fine, talk to you then. - I had a great time. - Nice, alright. - Bye, see you around. - Bye! I think towels are not for me, I like cups better. I've never tried it but I've heard it's really good If you're working out, nothing will happen to it. But whenever I use the cup, I have to use a towel too, I'm like... Monumental. I think it gets loose, but I probably put in on the wrong way, that's it. It's kind of bent, you pull it towards your anus, have you heard about that? - No, what do you mean? - You have to sit down and-- - And you pull it backwards. - My sister helped me the first time. Your sister is so cool. - Because my sisters are super shy. - They're square. - We're four women but still... - Yeah, it doesn't work between you. You don't talk about that? No, my sisters are married, they have kids. - Come on, are you ready? - Let's go! Hurry up. Let's go! Let's take a picture! Boot! Boot! Boot! Cheers! Thank you, thank you. Are you going to eat all that? Really? - Isn't it too much for yourself? - I don't think so. I had a girlfriend that wouldn't have eaten anything that's on that plate. She wouldn't even use the napkin. Burger, fries, beer... I love it. It makes sense because you're big. I mean... You're tall, you know? You have to eat more. Don't listen to me. Actually, my ex was really small. Yeah, very. I'm stealing some of your mayo. I just can't do it with mayo, not a chance. Well, I have to go soon. I'll go pay the check. Take my fries if you want to. No, no! Be my guest, I'm serious. Do you have two bucks by chance? I just fell short. I wouldn't have enough for the bus to Alajuela. It's fine. - I'll give it back tomorrow, I swear! - Dude, don't worry. Dude, it's okay. - You can have my burger, I'm full! - No man, I'm good too. - You really have to go now? - Yeah, the bus leaves every hour and-- - Can't we wait around for the next one? - I just really have to go, it's late. But, let's do this, let's meet up Saturday! - Sure. - Yeah? "Little stones at my Window." "Once in a while joy throws little stones at my window." "It wants to let me know that it's there, waiting..." "... But today I fell calm, almost level-headed." "I'm going to put anguish inside of its hide-away and I'll lie on my back..." "Which is a gallant, comfortable pose to receive news, and to believe them." "Who knows where will my next footprints will be, when my story will be noted." "Who knows which advices I'll invent and which shortcut I'll find to cheat them." "It's fine. I won't gamble eviction, I won't tattoo memory with forgetfulness." "Many things are left to say and to suppress." "There are still grapes to fill your mouth with." "It's okay, I am persuaded. May joy stop throwing little stones." "I will open the window, I will open the window." Do you like Benedetti? What do you think? How did that make you feel? I-- I don't know, I didn't understand it very well, but you can explain it to me. You know what I feel? Here it says... I mean-- It speaks about joy throwing little stones and everything but... But I felt that joy to be dangerous, did you feel the same? No? I mean joy is there, outside of the room, but it's not-- What's up? Nothing. You want me to read you another poem? Okay. - It's a really good poem. - Now? You will read it right now? Yeah, yeah. I could. Don't you think we are going too fast? Going where? Watch your distance! Hey, move! Move, move! We had it backwards, defense had holes, some were behind, some were upfront. When we have the ball, we all form a line. So, who am I going to pass the ball to if everyone is next to me? We need depth people, and the moves needs to move out! - But Carlos, they are cheats because-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah... She says to me, "Don't touch me, you will get a penalty for it." She said "You didn't touch me with both hands." And that's when I hit her hard, like the idiot she is. Thank you. Salad? This is really good, thank you. No, thanks. Where are you from? I'm from San Carlos. Could you pass me the I'm from Ciudad Quesada. - Do you live there with your family? - Well, I... I live in Alajuela. Now. - Alone? - No, I live with a cousin of mine. Salt, please. - Why Alajuela? Well, I first lived there because I was a student in the National University. So I ended up staying, it's a bit cheaper than San Jose. - Oh, right. - For the rent. - Do you have a car? - No, not yet. Yeah... What does you father do in San Carlos? He... He sells stuff. For example, he imports a lot of... Kitchen utensils, industrial blenders, tables... Tables like... Like special tables for bakeries, and also frozen chambers for food storage. And all that, yeah. Sometimes he brings them from the US, sometimes from here. He's basically a salesman - I didn't like it. - What? - I don't know. I didn't like it. - Well then, we won't do it again. It's easier that way. - Did I embarrass you? Your parents? - Me? I wouldn't have brought you. - No, they're the ones who embarrass me. - Stop, stop, I'm serious. No, it's not serious. - I don't get you. - Don't get so serious. You were the one who was all serious, at the table. You acted weird. - I wasn't serious. - I've never seen you like that. - Because it was the first time. - Obviously, I know. Stop tickling me! Did you want me to come here? Oh, I see... - Don't get mad. - I'm asking you, yes or no? Yes, I did want to. - I wanted to come here too. - Good. See? Now we can leave. We came, and now-- You're not ticklish here? Cheers! Cheers everyone. Dear God, you have amnesia now. - What is that spiciness I taste? - It's the pepper, young man. - It's really good. - He has amnesia now. Cheers! I'm not as cheery anymore. Maria Jose, do you have a boyfriend? - Well, I have a friend... - A friend! - They say friends now! - The boyfriend! That's right! You told me he was from Pérez Zeledón! - No! He's from San Carlos! - It's the same thing. - Does he go to your university? - Yes, we are classmates. He studies anthropology, what are you going to do about it? Who studies anthropology any more? We are not going anywhere, but that's what the youngsters like these days. - What's his name? - His name? Javier, but it's not like-- - We just met, it's not a big deal. - It's not a big deal then? - Already with a boyfriend? - Yes, he already came here and we met. The fact that he's from San Carlos Or that he studies anthropology doesn't make him lesser. How dare you? - Poor guy. - No, you're right, poor guy. Because of you, not because of Maria Jose! - Right, Maria Jose? - He's saving up for a car! Just in time for your dad to tell his history about getting his license. That is so embarrassing. You will win him over with that story. - What's his name? - Javier, mom. Javier! You're denting it! - You're going to dent my car. - Are you ready? Ready? You're the one that isn't ready, my dear. - Where are you going, all dressed up? - We're going to a wedding, baby. - Wedding? What wedding? - And you're wearing my mother's dress. But this thing is horrible! I know, but you can't go dressed like that. - God, you stink. - Fuck off, you reek of perfume. Maybe the Queen Isabel guide us, the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. Alé, we're out! - Where are we going? - I don't know, this place right here. - Which cousin is it? You have hundreds. - I don't know, the 34th cousin. Let's see, alé! Let's go! Navigating! - I'm ready. - (GPS tracking instructions) Baby, you are so messy. Look at my car. - You're ready? - I am, are we getting high or what? What are you doing? Shit! Lady? Hey! No! No, no! What do you-- Get off me! Think! Don't! Lady-- Why the fuck are we out here? I like that one. - Try this. - Oh, that's delicious! Dieguito, Dieguito! The champion, Dieguito! I'm number 10, what did you expect? - That's what the girls like. - But did you see that penalty? God damn, so, what now? Thank you. That one girl always calls out a different name, each time. - We already know-- - We know how the things play out. No, no. But lately, she has been hammering on that Diego thing. - Is she a fan or something? - After every game, every Wednesday... She is there, waiting for him, he doesn't even hang out for a beer now! - Who is keeping count? - Fuck, man. The champ. If she sees him in the field, that's it. Why do you think he doesn't run? Why doesn't he throw the penalties? That's what it is? That fucker. One thing is not running, but not throwing penalties is another thing. The next time, what you need to do is-- There's the pipe. What you need to do is, if you are too fucked up, if you are strained out.. - You just don't throw the penalty. - You have to watch those penalties. Dude, you reached the 4th period. I hear this guy here reaches the 6th one. Is that true, man? You reached the 6th period? I reached the 7th, the 8th and the 9th too. - Oh, he's daring you to come after him. - No, he is trying to come inside him! Oh, no... Maria Jo, we're leaving now. The maintenance money is on the table. If you need anything, just write me. (TV anchor speaking in the background) --Staying for days, even months.
