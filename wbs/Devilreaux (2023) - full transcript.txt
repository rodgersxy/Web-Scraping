Thank you. So you wanna clean and decorate here? Yeah, babe. Ugh. That shit right there is where we're gonna see an increase in sales. Yeah. The detail on this shit is crazy. It's so creepy. I love it. Yeah, I bet. What was that? Damn it, the cat must've knocked over my surprise for you. Present? Woman, you know I hate surprises. Look, babe. Huh? Whatcha got? What is this? Hmp. Cowbells? A full Devilreaux experience. You need to be careful with this shit. Playing around with the dead, and-and calling them with cowbells? The hell? Damian Louis Marcus. Are you scared of an old, dumb ghost story? Now, come on. Whatchu think? Nah. Everything's gotta be so perfect. Whoops. My bad there, pretty boy. Let me just get you just right. There we go. Ah. Babe, do I have everything down here? Oh, shit. Ugh. Dr. Turner. - Sure. - Hey, Bobbie. I may need to push dinner back a bit tonight. You okay? Yeah, you know. It's just work. Well, when you say "push back," do you mean like an hour or you wanna reschedule? Uh, nope. Hour's good. I miss my mom. I just... Well, I see my next patient in 20 minutes. And then I've got the rest of the afternoon free, so... Why don't I meet you at, uh, Willie Earl's Cowbells Restaurant? Okay, sounds like a plan. Alright, see you there. Talk soon. Hello, I'm Dr. Rothstein, I'm the hospitalist here and we're gonna be taking good care of you. How are you feeling? Not so good. We'll get you all taken care of. In the meantime, the lieutenant's here. Would you mind if I send her in? But-- Yeah, it-it's fine. Don't worry. It's gonna be fine. I promise. Momma. You'll be alright. You'll be alright. Hello, Lexy. I'm Lieutenant Bobbie Briggs with the Police Department. Do you know where you are? I guess the hospital. Do you remember the events that led to you arriving here at the hospital? Help! Help! Please! Lexy? I'm gonna go ahead and record this information. Is that okay with you? I'm also gonna give you a lie detector test. Why? I wasn't lying. Momma, I-- It's fine, it's fine. Let them do what they need to, sweetie. Lexy. It's more of a formality. Especially with cases like this, okay? Baby, how do you feel now? I'm in pain. Momma, what happened to my friends? - Baby! Baby, baby! - Did they-- You have been in a accident and suffered serious trauma. Lexy? I need you to tell me. Do you remember any of the events leading up to what brought you to this county hospital? Momma, what's going on? - What are they doing to me? - Baby. Baby, baby, baby! We are here to help. Lieutenant Briggs is-is looking for answers. That's it. We all are! Some of the things you were saying didn't make much sense. Why? What was I saying? Lexy? I need you to focus. Just think. What happened before the accident? We were lost. Then they were dead. And I couldn't get away. We just wanted to play the game for a bit and fool around, that's all. You had mumbled something about the farmhouse. Is this the old, historical farmhouse? Okay, what game? We always played there. Because of the origins. It-it started there. Rachel and Mandy, they-- they thought it would give us a better chance to connect. - We didn't want to. - What-- Uh-- Why don't you give her a chance to take it all in, before you ask her all these goddamn questions! Lexy, did you hurt your friends? - No. - What kind of question is that to ask? It's pretty straightforward, ma'am. Lexy, when you brought in here, you had various blood DNA on your clothing. I need to know. How did that blood get there? Oh... Rachel? Oh, Rachel. No! I-I saw them die. They were cut open. They were nothing but rag dolls to him. He was relentless. He tried to get me, but I fought. And I fought! The blood... smelled. He knew that place inside and out. His eyes had so much rage. Lexy, you said "him". Did you see who did this? - Who did this, Lexy? - Uh, that-- Give my-my daughter a break, okay? We can do this again tomorrow, if she wants to. We need this information, ma'am. - It's okay, Mom. - Are you sure? - I can talk. - Okay. It was Devilreaux. Who? He tried to kill me. I'm so sorry, baby. - Didn't even offer. Just... - inhaled it. Thanks. Man, did I? It was good. Hmm. You like this spot. I do like this place. It has history. Plus, the food is freaking amazing. - With all that sugar you consumed... - Mm. ...you should be the walking billboard for anti-diabetes. - Okay? - That has got to be the best bread pudding - this town has to offer. - Yeah. You must be happy Dylan's in town. I will be. He gets in this weekend. Oh. I thought he was already in town. I did tell you he's planning to stay with us for a while? - You mentioned that. - Yeah. How do you feel about that? Great. I feel great about it. Hello? What's up, lady? What do you know about Devilreaux? Devilreaux? Why would you bring that up? Didn't you write a book about him? No. No, actually, it was about my great-great-cousin, Kelly Turner and her husband, Jim Michaels, Jr. Lexy Allen shows up at the hospital after getting hit by a car. She tells us she was running from this killer. Jesus. I hope she's all right. That's my-my son Dylan's little girlfriend. She's fine. Just pretty scared. As well as she should be. Devilreaux is not something you should take lightly. Not if you believe in all that. Something about this girl and her friends disappearing at that old, historic farmhouse. Wait, we are talking about the same Devilreaux here? The urban legend? The children's ghost story? The old Michaels farmhouse, where Devilreaux became the Bogeyman story. You know, parents shared with their kids. So this is just some urban legend myth? Well, an urban legend is just a bunch of folklore stories circulated as true. Usually having happened to a friend of a friend. You know, entertainment, campfire stories. But Devilreaux... That's a true story. Happened right out there on that land. Willie Earl was amongst the deadly three that night. Along with the sheriff, Tom Whitman, and Jim Michaels, Jr. Who killed Devilreaux? The only son of the known voodoo witch. The voodoo witch then brought him back from the dead to seek his revenge and cursed the bloodline of all involved. My bloodline. And cursed all who would mock and disrespect who he was. Cursed the non-believers. Some have dubbed him the Lwa . The keeper of the graveyards and resurrection. The giver of life and The Master of the Dead. Seriously? They say when he comes for you, he violently kills you and anyone who gets in his way regardless. Using the same shovel he was brutally beaten to death with. And then he takes your soul, with some. The bodies disappear with him. Peter, you didn't buy into this shit? It's an old ghost story. Well, most ghost stories have some basis in truth. Listen to this ridiculous tale. Okay, so how does this little ghost tale end? I don't know. I fear for my life with this one, with this tale. And I have protected my family anyway I can. Sage, prayer, oils, and cleansing baths. Ever since the death's longed, the bloodline got closer now. It was blood that brought him back. And blood is the answer on how to destroy him. I fear for my life with this one, with this tale. Ghost stories. Urban legends. Copycat. Hmm. Halloween. Michaels farmhouse. Wait. What the hell is this? Jim Michaels... Baron Devilreaux. I don't know how you do it, Michaels. You have so many of them working for you. Be careful over yonder, Kelly. You kids watch what you're doing. We should be leaving soon. Kelly looks like she's ready for a nap. Yes, sweetheart. Okay, well, uh, me and missus, we just wanted to stop by and extend our condolences. We were truly sorry to hear about your wife. She was a good woman. Yes. Very well-loved at church and always made us feel welcomed. And even treated Kelly like she was her daughter. Yeah, you've got so many coloreds out there. Hmm. They work so well together. You know, watching them work, it's like watching ants work. That's what they remind me of. Ants. Wow, look at that big son of a bitch out there. That big black buck. Ha-ha! Is he new? There's some more. That'll work. This is gonna kill us. Huh? That big one? - More lemonade, Master? - Is he, Sallie? Oh, shit, don't play dumb with me. Is he a big one? I know that's the papa to that baby you're carrying up in that belly of yours. He best be the papa of that child, right? Yes. He be the papa of my child. Look at those kids play. Full of life. You know, Turner, like it or not, those two will own this place one day when they're grown and married. - Pardon me? - I bet my life on it. Oh, Lord. They're just children. No, I agree with you, Jim. A new generation of Turners and Michaels. You mean Michaels. The woman will take the man's name when they wed. I understand what you mean, yes. But Kelly's gonna be the one cracking the whip both on little Jim and on a whole new litter of slaves. Sallie. You look like you're about to break water this-this summer. Yes, sir. Doctor says it could be a couple of weeks. Maybe close to the end of June. Well, maybe a Fourth of July baby. That would be nice. Yes, ma'am. That would be nice indeed. Speaking of the Fourth of July... you know us Michaels always have our celebration, and even though you are semi-new to the town, I'm inviting you to come celebrate with us. Well, Thank you, Mr. Michaels. - That's nice, huh? - Yes. - It would be an honor. - That does sound exciting. You've been so kind to us, I don't know how we could ever repay you. Well, I'm sure you'll think of something. Kelly! Come, we have to go. Okay. Ah. Don't you worry yourself. He's gonna be your husband one day. Ain't that right, Junior? Alright. On that note, we best be going. I'll see you, Turner, on the Fourth. Sallie, get your ass in the house. Now. Get! I choose to cast out my buckets. I can't take it anymore. I can't take these chains and these whips. We need to be free. Huh? You're confusing me, Leonard. We need to go. We need to find a new life. Reggie from Baton Rouge. He says he has a place for us just off the river. And do what, Leonard? Look over our shoulders for the rest of our lives? Wondering when Jim Michaels will come and hunt us down? Where are you thinking of going? Not "we"... I said "me". "We." Not "we". We need to go somewhere where we can-- we can just start life. And where do you think we will end up, huh? We escape here, they will hunt us down. Probably hung us up real good to one of them grand moss trees. You. Me. And my baby. I can't do this, Leonard. I says no. No. No. No. My baby is not gonna be raised no damn fool. He's gonna be educated. Maybe a doctor. Right? No baby of mine is gonna be a slave. What are you thinking here? How are we gonna escape this? And I'm about due with your child. Why now? Why tomorrow? Because tomorrow's the Fourth of July. These crackers gonna be sipping and chugging on their liquor from sun up to sun down. They're gonna be too busy to-- to look for us coloreds. I think that would be even more dangerous. Them being drunk and all. Ah. Maybe wait until our baby is born? No. No. No. No. Things are different now. You know, ever since Michaels' wife died. Before, it was almost like we were part of the family. Almost. But things are different now. It's almost like Michaels blames me for his wife dying. We gotta be free. - We gotta-- I need my dignity. - Please, Leonard. Please don't leave me. Please, I can't do this alone. - Listen, listen. - Please! Listen, Sallie. Sallie, Sallie, Sallie. I love you. You're my wife. Okay? - Please, I need you. - I love you. Please don't leave me. Listen. I'm gonna be-- I'm gonna be waiting for you. And I'm gonna build us the biggest house you've ever seen. For us. For all of us. This bitch right here will let you have her if you command her to. Ain't that right, Sallie? Please, mister, please. My child. Even better. Grant me the strength not to send you two more devils. Sallie, be prepared. You're gonna have fireworks of your own tonight. Jim Michaels, you around? Hah. Where's all that festivities you promised me? Jim Michaels? Grant me the strength. Where are you? Hey, where's all those festivities you promised me, huh? Jim? Hey, Michaels, I'm sorry I'm late. Yeah, the missus at home is sick. Yeah, I got Kelly at home taking care of her. Jim Michaels, where are you? I got a pie. Alright, Jim, where are you? You are a rascal one. - Please! No! - Stop squirming! Jim Michaels, I got you pie. No! - Get up! Come on! - Don't rape me! It is time for the fireworks! - Jim? - Come on now. No! Please, my baby... Please! - Yeah! - No, I beg you. Come on, Sallie! Give some of us. Oh, my God. No! - No! Please! - Just sit back and enjoy it. - No! - What in God's name are y'all doing-- - No! Please! - Oh, stop moving, dammit! Oh, you are wildly playgirl. You are gonna have the time of your life! - Stop fighting this! - Stop it, please! - Lets sit back and enjoy girl. - Please! What the hell have you done? - No, Leonard! - Stop fighting me! Don't do it! - Get up! - Leonard, stop! Stop! Don't do it! Stop him! Stop squirming! Leonard! - Huh? What? Come on! - Please! Damn it! Come on. Say it, huh? - I dare you! - Leonard, no! Your money and your thievery don't own me any more. - Today, you crossed it... - Don't do it! ...when you put your hands on that wife of mine. I'm gonna pay you. I'm gonna take your life as payment in full. Say it. I dare you. Say it. Call me a nigger. - No! - Son, you did good. Pa's proud of you. Let go, look at me. Look at me. Look at me! Now, listen to my words. You run down the yard to the sheriff and you bring him back up here with you. You understand? Alright. Now get. Go ahead. Get. Look at the mess you made. Get your black ass up and start cleaning up, now. Shut your filthy mouth. Where am I? Some baby. Rest you must. Safe. Safe. From the garbage I found you in. Child, oh, so safe. Child. Safe. Now. Husband. Spirit... roams with us. Your child. This son. He has received. From us. My child. Where is he? Your son. Oh, so safe. My son. Where? Where is he? Your son... With... Are now... You. Your child. Gifts he has received from us. He is important. Powerful he is. My eyes. I can't see much. Why are you helping me? Sallie. Sallie, yes. Let me help you. Mr. Angus, you're looking awfully handsome tonight. How're you feeling, Mrs. Dorothy? Mrs. Dorothy, I know you hear me talking to you. Well, I'ma need some more milk. No? Okay. Well, I'm not gonna argue with you. Kelly, my beautiful wife. What is it? You look as worried as you did on the night of our wedding. I just want everyone to have a good time tonight. And I have this pie I baked for Baron. Where is he? That's right. It is Baron's birthday. How ironic. Former slave born on the day of our Independence. Isn't that wonderful? So liberating. Magical. Indeed. Well, darling, don't you worry about it. I'm sure he'll turn up. Last I saw him, he was over by the barn he'll turn up. Welcome, make yourselves at home. - Ah, hi there. - Tom. Good turnout this year. Tom, you lovely bastard. I didn't think you would show. How's things with you and the missus? Fantastic. She's over by the barn right now. Finding Baron for his birthday pie. Celebrating the birthday of your slave as well as America. Tom. Having slaves in these times would be cruel and illegal. We have ranch hands that we pay now. That Baron boy is a good model. I don't really remember his father, Tom. Baron, he's a good man. We rather enjoy having him around. Come join our party. Meet some of our friends. - Um, thank you. - Mm-hmm. I really appreciate it. I'm just finishing up here with Dorothy. Ah, now, now, Mrs. Dorothy. I said I'm finishing up with you. She's very protective. Dorothy? You talk to the cows? That is cute. Yeah, you see that one? The small one? That's Mr. Angus. And the other one? That's Mrs. Dorothy. And that's Mrs. Bertha. You-you name the cows? - Yes, ma'am. - Why? Well, I figured if I am gonna get all in their space and be touching on them, then I would want them to like me. So I gave 'em names. That's awfully kind of you. Do they know who you are? Yeah, they know me. They agree, I guess. You know, but they're, um, just a little overprotective of me of other women. That's it. Um, Mrs. Dorothy. Mrs. Bertha. Mr. Angus. This here is the boss lady. This here is Mrs. Kelly Michaels. - Did they respond? - Yeah. No. Oh. It's feeding time. Come. That's enough work for this evening. It's your birthday. I want you to have fun, too. - I baked you a pie. - I appreciate it. It's mighty kind of you. Well, boys. I'm about to get out of here. Michaels, thank you for your hospitality, stay out of trouble. Thanks for stopping by, Tom. And you be safe out here in these mean streets of Trotwood. Oh, hell. I will drink to that. Good night. So... you mean to tell me, you don't got a problem with that? With what? That black bastard. Skinning and grinning with your beautiful white wife. Who? Baron? He's harmless. Part of the family. Huh? I bet he wouldn't be so harmless if he found out you was the one who pulled the trigger on his daddy. What? You didn't think I knew about that? Hell, the entire town knows about that. What makes you think he doesn't know? Just waiting and planning to take revenge on you and your family one day. Maybe rape that precious daughter you got upstairs in that crib. Not me. No, sir. I would chop him up. Stop that train before it leaves the station. Look at them. Go on, look. Sheriff Tom. You have no idea what you are talking about. You've been drinking, sir. Trying to push me just as your father pushed mine. Oh, yes, I remember things too. Times have changed. Sheriff. Have they? I know that all those big black bastards fantasize about being with a white... trophy. He touches her. She then touches him. You understand what I'm saying, Jim? Jim? Come back to me. That's just bullshit. Bullshit maybe? Explain that. So, you're just gonna let his dirty hands all over your white wife? Yeah, I am thinking you are a killer. The man who blew that bastard's father's head clear off. Man. Jim. Your daddy is probably turning over in his grave right now. Knowing you allowed that man to have his way with your white wife. And not just any man. The son of the man that you killed. That's why we killed that son of a bitch, Lincoln. Wouldn't leave shit alone. They make good slaves. And you... pay that one to comfort your wife. Attaboy, Michaels. Lord Jesus. No. No. No! It's happening! Momma, what is it? What do you feel? Death. Bastard! You molesting my wife? God, Jim. What are you doing? Stop this! You get outta here. You've done enough. Stop this right now! Have you lost your mind? I didn't mean to-- You know what you did wrong, boy. You've been here touching up on his white woman in the man's house. What? No. No! This is a mistake. - Please! - No! I fell. Baron helped me up. Looks like he was forcing himself upon you. Oh, sorry. Isn't that right, Jim? I was just trying to help the missus. Enough of his damn lies. Put an end to it, Jim. - Women and children, get to the house. - Hey! - No! No! - All the boys stay here, y'all need to learn. - You did wrong boy. - Yeah! And ring the bell, man. No! It's happening. Death. How could you? All of you. He was a good man. He didn't deserve to die like an animal. We brought you a little gift. Jim Jr. You have stained your hands twice with Devilreaux blood. Last I heard... slavery ended 25 years ago. And? This now is murder. You were able to hide once behind your daddy's pants as he claimed once then as his property. What the hell is she talking about, Jim? Willie Earl, don't you know? What? How do you know my name? You won't get a chance to kill again. Bet on that. I didn't know it was your son. I swear. It? It was a person. It had a name. It loved playing with this toy. I know that voice. Your old voodoo bullshit doesn't scare me. - Oh. - Black hag. Oh. Oh, it will. Tom Whitman. We screwed up. We screwed up big time. Tom. She's gonna come for us. There's nothing we can do about it now. The boy's dead. The boy is dead. He's not coming back for no one. We beat him up pretty bad. You nearly took his head, plum off with that shovel. How can we be sure of that? Because he's dead, Jim. Oh. You're worried because his momma thinks she's a voodoo priest. Horseshit. You know how many people come back from the dead? None. Not even Daddy Devilreaux. And you know why? Because he can't. Right, Willie. Yes. Because he's dead. - Okay, Jim? - Okay. Come home, my son. Baron... Devilreaux. Come home. Come home, my son. Child, instead of watching me, come help me. He will be here soon. Who, Momma? Take those materials and get the sewing done. I'm scared. Being scared of him is not what I need from you right now. Embrace him when he comes as you once did as your husband. Momma Sallie, what did you do? I did what was needed. The world needs Devilreaux to bring a balance to this corrupted scale of justice. No more will we hide and fear. No more will they take more from me. No more disrespect. No more tears will flow from your eyes. No more sadness. Rejoice. Tonight he will live on in their thoughts. In their fears. Their thoughts will create energy, will create him. Devilreaux. Devilreaux! Come home. Come home to us! I knew you would return to me, my son. This bell will now strike fear in the hearts of your enemies. Their fear of you will bring energy to your body. Tonight, the birth of Devilreaux will arrive to seek vengeance on all who done you wrong, my son. When they hear your bell, they will fear death. Death... will judge the sinners. Open your eyes, my son. You need to relax. You did the right thing. You handled it the way any man would have. Rubbing his hands all over your wife. You did the right thing. I would've... I actually helped you. Baron. Is that that bastard's name? Yes. Sounds rich. No. Uh, he worked for me for many years. In fact, in all the years that he worked for me, he never once did disrespect me nor my family. Huh. He was a slave for my-- His parents were-were slaves for my parents. Yep. That I know. Look. This will all get covered up by the sheriff. Wait a minute. Look at that. I am the sheriff. No crime, hell. I think I'll retire for the evening. Is there anything else you require? Nope. Well, it's getting late. I am so sorry. Baron. Holy shit! Briggs. Hey, it's Baker. Get down to the hospital. Lexy remembers everything. I'll be right there. How're you feeling? Better. Any news on my friends? Lexy. I need you to go back to the beginning and tell me everything you can remember, okay? Okay. You said you went with some of your friends to party and, uh, play some games at the old Michaels historic house, correct? - Yes. - Okay. You had said that it was you, Rachel Worth, James Whitman, Tim Redland, Mandy Newton. - Correct? - Yes. Dylan Turner was supposed to come, but he wasn't back in town yet. I don't know about you, but that crawfish was fire. Well, I'm just saying. Yo, this house is scary. You'll be fine. Don't be a big baby. Guys, are we sure this is a good idea? Well, should we go in through here? Yeah. Go. - Alright. - Yeah. Come on. What about Jimmy? Jimmy's parking. Could we have not gone through the front door? - Oh, shit. - It'd be fine. - Yo, watch yourself. - Ah. Ugh, what's that smell? I don't know. Lexy, I can't believe you got us up in this mess. No for real, did you fart? - No. - Just kidding. Okay, come on. This place is creepy. You know what I mean? I don't know about this. Hmm, fancy. I hate this place. - Ugh, don't be a Debbie Downer. - Shh! - Why do we keep coming back here? - Hurry up. Come on, guys, it'll be fun. - Got some big plans. - This is crazy. Ah! Whoa! Yo. Almost gave me a heart attack. Someone gets scared easy. - Jimmy. - What? Come on, man. That crawfish messed me up, man! Man, whatever. Go find a bathroom. You also stated that you had smoked some marijuana. Played a Ouija board that you purchased at a magic shop? Yes, we bought it from Lola. The Queen of Voodoo. Her magic shop. Yeah, that's what you stated. Lola was telling us the legend of Devilreaux and the various ways we could summon him. If you're a bloodline, he'll show up. I found out some of us have ties to the Devilreaux story. You believe in that? Sure. Doesn't everyone? So tell me. What did you do to summon him? We played the damn game. I thought it would be fun to play with someone's blood, but no one wanted to do it. So I said, "Screw it." And I did it. You did what? So where the hell is Jimmy? Should we wait on him? Oh, God. That crawfish though. Hit him real quick. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. That's probably where he is. It was fire, not gonna lie, but it got me, too. Mm. So, guys, we have the game. Who's gonna be the sacrificial emblem? You expect me, a black man to cut my hand to bring a ghost back from his grave. - Right. - Some voodoo vigilante ghost. Man, you're crazy. - Mandy? - Nope. - My girl Rachel? - Don't even think about it. My God, you guys are no fun. No, it's all you. Fine. I'll do it myself. Hm, I... - Ugh! - Ugh. Lexy. Hmm. - Jeez, Lexy. All that blood? - Ugh. - Mmm. - I mean, that's a lot of blood. I cut myself playing the board game. It's no big deal. I've done it numerous times before. What? You've cut yourself? Yeah. No, big deal. Does your mother know you cut yourself? So then why would you do-- Don't read into anything, lady. Alright? I'm fine. I'm not depressed. I don't hate myself. Nothing like that. It's just shit kids do. I wanted to summon the so-called Bogeyman of the South. Okay, let's get back to Saturday. So then what? We smoked some strong shit. We bought it from some guy on a website where you can meet and, well, buy whatever. Is that when you all got separated? Mm-hmm. Me and Rachel, we-- we went outside to meet the delivery guy. When we came back in, everyone was gone. - We paid top dollar for this. - That much. - Yo, guys, we're back! - Guys! Where the hell did these people go? I knew we shouldn't have split up. They're probably about to jump out and scare the shit out of us. Did you know they're planning to add to that fun house? It's supposed to be like a carnival or some shit. If something cool would come to this area, besides this museum... How exciting. I'd rather watch fireworks at the river with Dylan. Oh, Dylan. You're just jealous. Where did I leave that board game? You left it in the red bag. And Mandy has the red bag. She took it after we played the game. Ugh, my frickin' hand still hurts. Well, no one told you to slice it open like a damn savage. I said I was gonna do it next time we played. It was pretty epic. Hm. I bet you they're up stairs. Yo, guys. This place must've looked so beautiful in its day. The parties, the events, the history. The murders. The war. This place has seen some serious shit. What murders? Hello? Devilreaux? The shit during the Civil War. The bloodline curse. The shit you were doing with the board game, cutting yourself. Chanting that crap. You really believe in that shit? - Duh. - Sad. What? Next you're gonna tell me that... - What happened? - Did you hear that? Sounded like a bell. Like a cowbell. Legend states that people hear a cowbell right before Devilreaux pops up and kills them. Come on, guys. - Boo! - What-- - Ow! - You asshole. - Not funny. - Yeah, well... Come on, let's just go and find the others. Wait. Do you hear a rubbing sound? Like something being cut. Tsk. Ugh. Let me hear? Mm-hmm. I don't hear anything. Oh, my God! Rachel. Rachel? Rachel, are you okay? Rachel? - I just hurt my leg. - Okay, we're gonna get you help, honey. What-what do you see? What's down there? It's dark. Okay, I'm gonna give you the flashlight. Hold on. We're gonna get you help. What-what do you see down there? It's basement crap. It's just another section that we've never seen. Okay, um, I'm gonna come down and try to help you, alright? No. No. I broke the stairs coming down. I'll just walk to the other side of the basement, okay? Just meet me towards the entrance. Are you sure you don't want me to at least try? I-- No. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just-- Find the other assholes and meet me towards the entrance so we can get out of here. Shit. This place smells like an outhouse. Actually, it smells more like a dead cat. Alright, I-I'm gonna go now, I'm gonna see if I can find the others and then I'll meet you at the front, alright? Fine. Just-- Can you please hurry up? I hurt my leg and my-- This place sucks. You got it, lady. Hang tight, okay? I saved the weed. This top dollar shit. Ugh. Ugh. I found the smell. It's a dead cat. What the hell? Where did they go? Where the hell are you people? Goddamn it. What's that sound? You better not be having an orgy, because that would just be gross. Y'all are too freaky. Mandy? Tim? Jimmy? Guys, come on already. Enough. Rachel hurt herself. She needs our help. I'm not playing anymore, guys. Jeez. Mandy? Tim? Jimmy? Come on, guys, Rachel's hurt. Enough of these games. I swear to Christ, if all you people are just trying to scare me... Mandy? What the hell? Lexy? Is that you? Yeah, are you blind? Where have you been? You look like shit. Mandy, what's-- what's going on? Where-where's Tim? Where are the other guys? There. The game. What? The-the game? Mandy? He-- He was dragged. Dragged? Mandy, who... Who did this to you? Was it-- was it Tim or Jimmy? Look, honey, let's just get out of here and call the police. - Okay? - Devil-- Devilreaux has him. We have to help Tim. My Tim. Mandy, Devilreaux? The-the game we played? It's him! You called for him! You offered him the bloodline, he came! Mandy, honey, you need to understand that was just-- that was just a game we played. It was a stupid game from a stupid magic shop, that's all. I just cut myself to scare you all. - I am scared! - Okay. He's real. Okay, look, let's just get Rachel, and we'll call the police and go home, okay? He has her too. What? Mandy. Mandy, I swear to Christ, if you'll are just trying to scare the piss out of me, you won, okay? So can we just go home now? Run! Rachel. Oh, Rachel. So you're telling me that Devilreaux, killed James Whitman, Tim Redland, Mandy Newton, and Rachel Worth? Is that what you're telling me? Yes, that's what I've been saying. Lieutenant, there are questions and we need you over here. - One at a time, please! - We need to understand. Can I get one question at a time? Sir? - Sir? - Lieutenant, were drugs and any narcotics found? I cannot disclose anything as of yet. Well, can you deny or verify that this planned group suicide may have gone bad? No. I cannot. What about the old, fabled Bogeyman legend of Devilreaux that may have had something to do with this cover up? That-- Did you hear how ridiculous that just sounded? Does anybody have a serious question for me, please? - No wasting time here, okay? - Yes, lieutenant. What about the unjustified brutality from last week that happened? - Any comments about that? - No comment. I can't disclose anything as of yet. I have told you, guys, I've given all the information that I can. I thank you for your time and attention to this very sensitive matter. But as of now, I have work to do. Lieutenant, that may have had something to do with these disappearances. You are hiding something. The public needs to know. Thank you very much. Can you confirm that these disappearances may have had something to do with-- Lieutenant Briggs, I need a comment. - You have not answered any of my questions. - - Hey, hey, hey! - You are not allowed back here. - I need-- I need to know. - Get out of here! - The people need to know about these disappearances. - Go upstairs! - Devilreaux had something to do with this. - Get out of here! - I need a statement! - Do you wanna be behind bars? - People need to know the truth. - Get out of here! - I'm gonna find out myself. Jesus. These people. Oh, my goodness. Jesus. I mean, they do not stop. They're relentless. Tell me about it, alright? This is just great. Another four missing kids, possible homicides, and to make things worse, parents and reporters with these bullshit theories. - Yeah. You're gonna love this. - What is it? The results of the Allen kid's lie detector. So she was telling the truth. You don't really believe that, do you? Something scared the hell out of her. I don't think Lexy Allen killed anybody. You believe that? I mean, there are ways that people can work or figure out how to pass a lie detector. Yeah. These are 20-year-old kids we're talking about here. Something happened and we need to figure out what. Okay, maybe Lexy did tell the truth, then. What? About Devilreaux? Uh, that's what you're implying. "Urban legend," Devilreaux? Come on. You know me better than that. Okay. I'm really sick of this. Something spooked them. She says four of her friends are dead. She takes a beating while running into traffic, gets hit by a car running from somebody. I've got to figure out what to tell these parents. Actually, chief said that he's arranging for a private briefing with them all. Christ. What am I supposed to tell them? One day we've got a missing person's case. And the next day it's imaginations running wild. I know. I don't know. We went back through the Michaels property with a fine-tooth comb. And we came up with nothing, except some dried old blood? Maybe? We're still running DNA tests, um, but luckily no sign of ghosts. So there's that. Well, these kids are somewhere. You know what I don't get about kids is they go to a some nasty, old deserted warehouse to screw and get high. They'd rather stay in some damp disease-infested, cold ghost house than spend 70 bucks on a damn hotel room. Like, I would never do that. That's just it. It's the rush of getting caught. You go to an abandoned place, you're cut off from life. From rules. Hmm. - You go to a motel... - That's interesting. Somebody will always see you. Interesting. What's this? That is the Allen girl on the end. Yeah. The one dressed like Devilreaux. And get this. Her mother's maiden name? Michaels. Michaels? As in Jim Michaels? Mm-hmm. Yeah, he's the grandfather of the bloodline. Hey, uh, can I get you another coffee? Absolutely. - Black. - Okay. It's gonna be a long day. Yeah, it is, before I head out. Great-grandfather. I'm leaving. Goodnight, Marg. Hello? Marg, is that you? Hello? Hello? Margy, is that you? Who that? Briggs? Strike fear in the hearts of your enemies. Did you see him? Do you need his picture maybe? I can give you his picture. - Did you ever see him? - Well? - Okay. Okay. - Please tell me he's alright. - I understand. Please, listen. - Oh, God. We have conducted a full search and a walk-through of the premises where Lexy Allen was found. But this has not, as of yet, hear that, as of yet, produced any further evidence or information that I can present to you at this time. - I'm sorry. - How do we know they did not leave the building? What if they're trapped inside of something? Possibly hurt? Like I said, we have conducted a full search. We have found evidence of people having eaten and slept in the lower levels. Probably vagrants. We are at this time waiting on DNA tests to officially come back, okay? Like I said, we're doing all that we can. I just want to give her a hug. - Well, find them, find them. - It's not enough. I understand. - Just... - Excuse me. - Where is she going? - What? Where is she frickin' going? Briggs. When? Nah, I already know the address. So what happens now? My daughter, Mandy, she's been gone four days. Did the Allen girl kill my child? Did she kill the others? Ma'am, we are doing everything in our power. Where did you go, Peter? Hey, Dad. I'm here. Dad? Dad-- Oh, hey, Miss Bobbie, where is my-- Where is my Dad at? Is he okay? Dylan. You arrived early? Yeah, my plane came early. Where is my Dad? Is everything okay? Dylan. I hope so. W-what happened? Not sure. All we know is that he dialed 911. And clearly, there's been a struggle. It's Devilreaux. He came for my Dad. He-he's gonna come for me next. Why are you saying that? He's real. I mean, I grew up watching my Dad freak out anytime he learned someone we knew disappeared and I always thought he was being ridiculous, but he's real. My-my Dad was right. - You believe that? - Of course, I believe it. Look. Lexy did it, didn't she? Did what? She played the stupid game. I told her don't screw with the dead. She must've done it. Lexy did mention cutting herself playing that game. I knew it. If you poke the bear enough times, he's gonna attack. Hey. Hey. Dylan. Look at me. I need you to be strong. We will find him. Dylan, I need you to take me through everything you all did playing that game. Okay. - Show me everything. - Okay. Okay. Now, we're gonna go in and go down through here through this spot. Be careful though, it's-- it's pretty steep. Okay. Not sure why we come through here, but this is the way we go. Yeah, that's interesting. Stay close though. Right through here. You guys never used the front door? Mm, this is the cooler way. It's through here. Miss Bobbie, it's this way. Here is where we usually play. And why in this room? Is there a reason? Just bigger, I guess? I don't know. I just kind of follow along with wherever they go. Sometimes we just kind of hang out all over the place in here, but this is mostly where we go. I usually sit right there next to Lexy. Rachel sits here. Sometimes we mix it around, but mostly me and Jimmy usually try to hang out toward the outskirts. We kind of play all around in here, but most of the time we just hang out here. So why here? What's so special about this room? Bigger. I-I don't know. I mean, I really just kind of follow along with whatever they're telling me to do, I guess. But mostly this room just 'cause it's the biggest and it's the creepiest for what we're doing, I guess. But that's really why they chose it. And that's where you play the Ouija board? Yes. Play right here, sometimes we'll play over here, but most of the time, this is the spot. And, uh, you know, we kind of move around down in here, but most of the time, it's right here. Alright, what else do you got? Onto the next place? - Yeah, show me. - Okay. Through here. And down through here is where we'd cut through to go to the fun house. Well, that sounds fun. Yeah, something like that. Step right up. Step right up. Step right inside the very haunted fun house. They don't come more haunted than this. Yeah, step right up. Come on in. Oh, well, you're one of the last guests to come in to the devil's fun house. Right this way. Do you usually do the fun house? Yes, ma'am. Down here. Watch your step. The Devil doesn't need a lawsuit on him, does he? Yeah. No one is usually here when we come, though. There's a crawl space area in the basement that leads to like a closet area inside. Interesting. Yeah. You know, this place is a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. Oh, yeah. It definitely does. Um... Alright, keep going. Show me. Right through here. Through here. Just keep going. Ugh! Jesus! I hate clowns. That flashbulb just blinded me. - Oh, yeah, me too. - Ugh, I can't even see. Ugh, this place has a bad smell, though. It's like somebody was cooking gym socks. Smells like wet dog in here. Yeah, that too. We'd hang out around here, but most of the time, we go behind the stage. Alright, show me. Through here. Interesting. Oh, yeah. We gotta go in through here. This is where we usually go. There. - That's him. - What? Dylan! Miss Bobbie! Dylan. Miss Bobbie! Dylan? Dylan! Dylan, answer me. Hmm.
