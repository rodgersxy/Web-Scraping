We begin ? - Does it record? - Yes. Just keep talking. Is that red thing in place? I imagine you, starting to prepare your film, but the tapes are blank... I'll fix it, wait... Why make a movie about me, Aaron? Keep talking. I was born... Go ahead. I'll tell you something you don't know. My name, Lou Andreas, is not the real one. Did you doubt it? No. No way. Few knew. It was the name of a very beautiful woman. I took it. I didn't know. And your real name? Emily. Yes. sand? No. Versene. Emily Versene? It's pretty. French? I thought it would be different. He insisted, "Lou, I want to see you, "I'll join you on the island." Finally I said to myself: This time, it's personal. But of course, always the same damn story. "Lou, are you working for me all night?" It was always yes. Result, I see a psychiatrist, and a simple cold disfigures me. Did you catch a cold? Usually, I'm prettier, you know. I took so many pills because of this dirt... What does your psychiatrist say? I'm gonna run down this beach screaming... A day. But do you know, I haven't done anything like this for a long time. I see a psychiatrist every week. Overpriced. I really try... to go well. I really have to work on it. I shouldn't be so inert. You look better than last time. I strive for it. Of course, if you hoped to find me beautiful... I told you, you're gorgeous. THANKS. But nothing to do, we are as we are. I'm not so young anymore. But whatever ? You know, I haven't made friends with anyone here. Person. You shouldn't stay isolated. I'm not in great shape. That's why I hesitated ΰ let you come. Then I made up my mind. If we don't know how to keep friends somewhere we have a serious problem. You are my friend. It's just. Let's come back ΰ... On the day I arrived in New York? Divine. Absolutely divine. You have my word. No, they don't look good. I don't even want you to see them. But that face! Dry ! Absolutely stunning! Gigantic eyes! And big... How much do you do? 1m75? 1m78. You don't do them... A giantess! A slender Venus. I know she will be picture perfect. I'll send it to you right away, you'll see for yourself. All right ? THANKS. You're an angel ! You, run, please ΰ Ida Saints Berry and your career is launched... Lou Andreas Sand. What a fabulous name! THANKS. It's Andreas Sand, and it's not... Well, the device always adds five, ten kilos... As thin as you are, you can lose two or three. Two or three. What to do with your hair? Are you there, Lou Andreas Sand? Barbara Casey. We were expecting you. For a long time. Pardon. It's not my fault... It's nothing, but we're late. Here it is finally. Why did you bother? Do not pay attention. Come, let us dress you. No, not so adjusted, It should float, Margo. I know, it was to try. Especially not. Ida wants them in black and white and in color, just in case... It is a painful rag to look at. If I enter ηa? Ηa gives more form. Are you wearing fake boobs? Did I put them? Lord. All these men staring at me as demented or obsessed. Let's go, Alex. Anyway, it looks like nothing. Sexy like canned tuna! Honey, if you raise your arm, you roll up your sleeve. Nothing. It looks like nothing. Come on, Alex, be nice... Do you remember my list, Aaron? Falco was the first name on the list of those with whom I no longer wanted to work. You have a pointed head. He does not like me. Raise the other hand. Stunning. Hold the pose. Do not move. Me... A parakeet terrifies me! But I did the cover. I remember. You remember it ? I'm really... very boring. No not at all. Do you find it exciting? It's interesting. Your hair, I can't believe it. It is divinely pretty. I adore this abandonment in men today, their appearance, with their hair... It's amazing. But... you all look like Jesus. How are we going to recognize him when he comes back? Could you describe the nature of your feeling for these anonymous people? I never talk about... sex. We don't talk about those things. Even on your little machine. If I broke the commandments? I don't even know them. Let's say I succumbed to pleasure. Did you experience any pleasure? Do you want to know a secret, Aaron? Tell me. Did you like me, At our first meeting? You had impressed me. You were... different. I didn't like you at all. It seemed to me that you were... very... hostile. Unfriendly. Only after 3 or 4 working sessions that I started to like you. Lord ! How awful ! But no, it's beautiful. You see ? How ηa, beautiful? Look at my face. Horrible. It reveals what you feel. We forget the dress. This is not fashion. Is it so serious? Do not you think ? Doesn't matter. It is very important. Of course, it's important, but... you take it too seriously. I'm like that, I take everything too seriously. You should not. Falco is not as... Do you have a cigarette? I like to learn from the man I am with, or work with. If he teaches me, I have the feeling of progressing. Falco is still mad at me. You think... Should I apologize to her? For what ? Because it is... a great photographer, and that he helped me a lot. Lou, he's watching through a hole the models, while they are changing. What ? Don't take it too seriously. It doesn't matter. You are too tense. But no not at all. It's nothing. I wanted to ask you... I'm tired, not tense. What ? Do me a favor. I have clients ΰ me... Remember, ΰ any time you asked me, "Lou, work for me." If you can get up early... Damn... 4:30 in the morning! I was thinking... We have to go fast. I know. It's very good. Are we taking pictures on Sunday? Who is Aaron Rhinehardt? He is an extremely talented photographer. He's also my friend. It doesn't matter, he can't hire you $10 per hour, for love or friendship. No. Pauline, it's her. The next top model, without a shadow of a doubt. This is Pauline Galba. How are you? I have always admired your photographs. I admire yours. Pauline and Barbara Casey hire you, with... - Cap. - With Capette. In Jamaica. - 2 weeks. - 3! For the cruise collection. She will pilot the plane that will take you away. It's wonderful, I know. I have never been abroad. The plane terrifies me. I never took it. I do not want to go. It will happen to you. It won't happen to me... certainly not. I'd rather stay and do little extras with you. Really. Once in the air, ηa will pass you. If I stayed and played with these old people? It's silly. No not at all. I loved a famous man, older than me. His plane crashed when I was only 16. So it's not stupid. It's true ? It's true. I was 16 years old. Were you lovers? Yes. Who was it? I will have to fly over these expanses, on Pauline's plane. I only know his photos, it's not a pilot's license! Nothing forces you to. But if. For what ? My job means a lot to me. What will the magazine think if I don't go? What do you think, a magazine? People, Aaron... Ida Saints Berry, Peggy McCavage, count on me. But no, they want you to believe that. One phone call and your replacement arrives. That's all. What are you into? Do you want to stop me from going? No way. You were saying... I will not stay for $10 an hour, for love or friendship. I'm going to Jamaica. Lou, wait a minute... Wait a minute. I am desperate. Don't be desperate. You will love ηa. I love nothing. I only like the President. And I worry about him. I will feed him as promised. Bring it to me. I should stuff him with pills and take him away. What language is it? Chinese! Let's go ? Just a minute. I would like to know one thing. I would like to know... whether you like me or not. Sometimes I feel like... Ask me that, at such a time, in my state? I just told you, So far I don't like anything. I did not speak of love. Simply, if I please... Can't you see I'm completely confused? I never talk about these things. If anyone wants something, take it. It's my philosophy. Your philosophy? I would rather die than leave. Do not worry. It is not so easy. You really dated an older man, 16 years old? Really ? I was 15. How did it happen? If it is not difficult for you. It's not painful. Just boring. So banal. By friends? No... It's not that... I forgot. It's too painful to talk about. It's nothing. We took his Cadillac to the airport. We had to be very discreet, he was famous, and I was so young at the time. He was talking about marrying me, to surrender... rich. If I had accepted, my life would have been quite different. But he crashed. I never saw him again. You would be dead, or a widow. I would have been safe. You seem somewhere else... It's the drugs. It was amazing, everything he taught me about myself, without even knowing me. That I was a recluse, rebel, artist at heart. Ready to convert to communism! I said I wouldn't fly to Las Vegas, that I had... fear. Did you read it in the newspaper? What ? That he had crashed. Did it even happen? It's just like, I never saw him again. Here they are! Dr. Galba, my husband. This is Lou Andreas Sand. Aaron Rhinehardt. We know each other. Let's go. We don't wait... Capette? She takes a commercial flight. Not mine. For what ? I don't know. His Saturn and my Mars, or what his astrologer would have said... She's crazy, you know. I do not know her. She's the perfect model, I adore her, but very unstable and very eccentric. Everything's good. Fasten your seatbelts. I know I'm not perfect. Perfect ! You are absolutely perfect! That's it! Capette should be ashamed. Relaxed. That's it. Very well. Hold the pose. More relaxed. Like ηa. Voilΰ. We'll get there, honey. Now calmly. As if he were at your feet. Tremendous ! Very beautiful! Marvellous ! It's very good. You can't imagine how hard it is to play. I would so like to find the thoughts that I jotted down at the time. They would better explain my atheism to you. I always have been, Because of this idea of ​​punishment. To be what we are, to think what we think. For example, would you take a picture of me today, as I am? I don't have my device. But you wouldn't. Because I am imperfect. My makeup is gone, I'm awful... I would have preferred to receive you at night. It hides so many things. You know very well that you are beautiful. Stop devaluing yourself. Thanks, Aaron, but I know how I feel. You know, only one thing I really miss. Grace. Living in a state of grace with somebody. I read somewhere that "man must find grace". Do you want to listen to Bach? I can play you Bach and other tunes on your recording. Let's save ηa for another time. Tell me about your return from Jamaica. Can I listen to the castanets again? Of course. It's very good. You can't imagine how hard it is to play. I would so like to find the thoughts which I wrote down at the time. They would explain to you better my atheism. I always have been, Because of this idea of ​​punishment. To be what we are, to think what we think. For example... would you like to take a picture of me today, as I am? I did not take my device. But you wouldn't. Because I am imperfect. You know, only one thing I really miss. Grace. Living in a state of grace with somebody. I read somewhere that "man must find grace". You were telling me your return from Jamaica. Can I listen to the castanets again? Of course. When I came back from Jamaica, you were gone, for California. One moment, please. Do you remember your letter? I have it there. This letter... that you left me when you left. I read it to you? I would like to read it to you. A moment... "Dear Lou, open my studio, corner of 22nd West and 66th. "The President is there, "My secretary takes care of him. "Call her. Rita: AC-33598. "I had to go to California with a model. "Not you, alas! "Lovely, Aaron." It was so nice. I kept it. I did not hear anything. Want to read it? Did you fold down the seat? For what ? I don't know. For what ? Does your wife force you to do this? She got you used to beating it down? It's not a habit, Lou. I want it to stay up. For what ? Excuse me. You know, Aaron, I really think it's all my fault. First of all, the situation I created. Afterwards, I don't have a man I'm in love with. There was always someone you loved always a man in your life. Many even. Many have loved me, but rare are those whom I have loved. Even at school. Everybody loved me but I didn't like everyone. I have always been rebellious. I was a leader for so many things. Work, will, sport. I didn't go out with the boys before I was 18-19. And this mature and famous man, the one you were in love with? He was in love with me. But I loved another all my life. Who is this ? I was not very sociable. I had no real friend in New York, except you, and... Paulina. You know, Pauline is very rich. European fortune. His family made the English napkins for all of Germany and France. English towels? They now own several sanatoria in Swiss. She received fascinating people at her table, that I was not so curious to know. Movie stars, theater people, people of the world... Greta Garbo, that type of person. English towels? I was the only model. I was sitting facing Mark. I met him there. You met Dr. Galba, a really lovely man. Pauline was very... annoyed that I become the focus. She could act so rude that his guests got up and left. Farewell. It exhausts me. Like a solo transatlantic. Well deserved a sherry. I will take some too, my love. Can you serve them? I'm falling asleep. Of course. My mother handled her guests like a tamer. Yet she remained as fresh as a rose. Why do we never see you? I am quite lonely. I go out very little. You should. She should what? Show off more. Don't hide so much. She is dedicated to her work. Not like so many others which are found everywhere. This is another extreme. I would like to see you again. These women have lost all mystery. They only think of being seen. You look good together. It is not the first coming. I see ηa. To tell the truth, I would like to hire you. Are you a photographer? I didn't know. I'm artistic director at Temple and Horn. I see you there already advertising coffee, deodorant, corn cream... More of a car brand, if you were interested. No, honey. You are not interested. She is a fashion model. Let her decide. It is taken for 6 weeks. Are you saying something, honey? I become deaf. I think I'll call a taxi. I drive you back. All right. You should stay here, honey. The farm ! For God's sake ! She works early tomorrow! It's more reasonable if she stays. Pauline, I think... I'm going to bed. Good night. Good night, Mark. Good night, my darling. Good night, Mark. Really, I better go home. If ηa is better, so go for it. I'll pick you up tomorrow, and early. Sorry, I don't kiss someone I don't know so well. What worries me is that you hook up with someone which has the reputation of Mark. Not moving. He's got that reputation... I know him, you know. Which ? Which what? reputation. Not moving ! Don't you know he made me advances behind Uwe's back. Lord ! Behind no one's back. On the floor of his studio. Want the details? No, honey. I will not give details. Nothing very flattering. He tries with all of them. He has this obsession with numbers. Maybe you find him attractive? Not me. She is hardly attractive. Do not move. GOOD. He must have tried to undress you right away. He's still a little boy, a child. Of course, he constantly tries to cuddle... I saw correctly. Pauline has been so invested in my career, I am really grateful to him. Don't get me wrong. I like it very much myself. It's my best friend. Could you change channels? "To keep me alive, "I watch the mysterious Mr. Wong fishing in the surf, "dusk after dusk, "until the early morning." It's a poem. It's pretty. I didn't have time to finish. I never have time. Aaron, you know, I can not stand it anymore. Enough to ? I can't stand being here anymore. Where? On this island? When I will come back, we'll go out, we'll talk. We'll see if... You know, I was waiting for the day... where I would leave this profession, in a house like this. Write poetry, paint... Now I'm here. A beautiful place, facing the sea, the boats in the distance, And... it's unbearable. Every morning get up is so... I'll be back, Lou. We'll see if... What ? When I will come back, we will talk. We'll try to find something. We will take the time to talk. I am ΰ the height? Yes... Trθs. Let me see. I love the spirit but it's weird. They are stiff. It does not come from the pose. There is no feeling. Aaron is annoyed. I would like the other to go away. Listen, Davy, if you kissed me your way? I'm like that... It's going to be hard. Where are you going? We'll be right back. You know, Davy, you don't do your hair very well. No ? It's the line that's wrong. You allow ? Does it bother you if I ask you if you have ever been in love? I sometimes feel respect, and I like to be appreciated. Mainly the creators. I'm not going to spend all day on a pub. It's better. THANKS. Please. So you've never been in love for real? Marlene Dietrich. I love it. You know her ? No. I almost went to a party where she was. I missed my chance. What if you imagined that I was her? She ? I don't know. Try. Do you remember this movie? How was it, Shanghai... ...Express. Yes. She played Shanghai Lily. That scene in the caboose... Her former lover, whom she still loves... Clive Brook. She is sitting, with her fur, the wind is blowing, and Clive Brook said to him: "Tell me there was no other man." And she : "I wish I could say it, "but five years in China, "it's very long." Not terrible. No, that's it. All ΰ does ηa. And then, when she's sitting down, with that hat on... Get up. He stands there like ηa, yes, and she attracts him ΰ she... What are they doing ? That's wonderful. We don't move anymore. It's very good. That's enough. What ? I was well? Of course. What's the matter ? Would you do me a favor tomorrow? Yes. Of course. For work? I am taken. That's a shame. I was thinking of going to the coast tonight, spend the night there, capture the morning light. I could say I have a migraine. I have a migraine. What would relieve you? Some wine. Imagine that we don't know each other. What ? I will enter alone, I'll order a glass of wine, and I will sit down. After one minute, you come in, you sit down, and you order a drink. Then you notice me. It's stupid... What do I say ? You will ask me my name, I will refuse. You tell me yours. But not Aaron. For what ? Mario Adonis. I didn't catch your name... Emily. Then you'll offer to buy me a glass of wine. From Chablis. It's Charlie. Sensational guy! I know. Then you will try to... get up. You are the portrait of my s Afterwards, you lure me to a hotel. More like a motel. It bothers me a little to tell you that, but I was thinking that maybe you would like to take a little trip in my truck? A big truck? Two tons. It's quite small, compared to other guys. Two tons ? It's big! Ever ridden in a two ton? Never ! I don't even know what it looks like. Mine is yellow. Easy to see. It's a yellow two-ton. My brother, he is a painter, he said to himself, I will tell you one day, that was good publicity. A yellow two-ton. It doesn't run the streets. We are going for a walk ? Ask ΰ anyone here, i am a regular guy. All right. Afterwards ? No ! Stop! Don't come for 5 minutes. I don't do that with anyone ! Lord! I am reserved. It's too precious for me. I am not a runner. A runner? You know, I only come for prescriptions. That's all ? To find out who... you really are. I already know that. And so ? I've had dealings with other psychiatrists, you know. At the hospital. You still have... 10 minutes. Make good use of it. As you want. A psychiatrist, stretched out on the ground, in his tennis shorts. He's still a great psychiatrist. I wait. One session a week is too little to be wasted. I am... a woman. Not a child. It is the man to take the first step. If he wants something, let him take it! Whether small or large advances. Have you ever had a satisfying relationship with a man? Have I already mentioned Davy? This boy had never loved, except for an inaccessible woman. What a wonderful thing for him to suddenly be able express it, that I offer him ηa. Davy, Pauline and I, We were in Paris. It was so beautiful. As if I were the only model in Paris. Let's move on to Paris. It would cost too much to shoot there. I want to focus on New York. Paris has been so important in my career. I know. But if you don't have a significant event... Something always happened. Always. I tried to kill myself. What's up with you, Lou? What are you doing ? What do they have, these windows? Help me, David. What's going on, Lou? I don't do anything good. I want to end it! Tell me what is happening. If I was pregnant? Here is what is happening. Ben Hamid is downstairs. Ben Hamid? Yes. I invited him over for a drink. ΐ such a moment? I don't want to see anyone. It was wonderful! This gentleman, who surrounded himself of the most beautiful women, wanted to see me... Let's not talk about it now. He had manners so respectful. Let's talk about something else. Stop annoying me! This gentleman asked me with so much respect a photograph of me, let me sign it... I will never forget his sweetness. I know. You caused a sensation. In effect. I am fulfilled. If that's one thing that got me... depressed. I just wanted to talk to you about it. I have an appointment for dinner, are you coming? My pleasure. Close your eyes. Always is it that a certain thing became clear to me in Paris. I tried to get out of the window. For what ? Because I was depressed. I am coming right now. Depressed by what? One thing worries me, even today... I arrive in a moment. It is not the moment. You constantly interrupt me. I'm sorry. Let's talk about it later. Get dressed and come. I want to introduce you to someone. This is Joan. Good morning. Nice to meet you. Aaron talks so much about you. He showed me pictures. Splendid. THANKS. Joan is a dancer. At c come from primitive impulses like fear and excitement of action. Each movement is a variation on this fear. Masks conceal reactions as much as they reveal them. The dancers are enlightened! In my case, that's correct. They are like nuns... Not necessarily. That's what they remind me of. We are sometimes very devoted. I didn't know. Are you a nun? ΐ you say it. I would like to leave. I don't feel very well. You haven't eaten anything. I'm not hungry. We haven't finished... Are you expecting us? Do not move. I will go home alone. You're not okay ? I have a migraine. Enchanted. Looking forward... I drive you back. Not worth it. Sit down. You live here ? Won't you invite me? You recognize me ? Wait, Emily! Come for a ride. Do not be afraid. I just want to chat. God be praised! I did not return directly. I took a detour. No, it's not right. Come quickly. Something serious is happening. No. There is a man... He followed me. He came into my house! He thinks I'm a communist. I didn't lie, for Paris. I just exaggerated. No, I'm not exaggerating. He stands there, facing me. One minute, wait. One minute. Say something. Say... Who are you? I have the police online. They arrive. He does not say anything. Please believe me, come now. I do not need you. I'll call Mark, he'll come right away. I do not want to talk to you anymore. Don't ever call me again. I do not want to see you anymore. Mark came and chased him away. Mark is so nice. He is in love with me. He asked me to marry him. You can do it ? I don't know. What do you think ? What do I think of it ? He has so much affection for me, he understands me on many points. You love it ? Lord ! Do you love your fiancee? Yes. What do you say ? I do not know. I'm asking you. Of course I love it. People often marry without loving each other. SO ? my wedding dress, you have never seen her. I chose it for its simplicity, its modesty. She's so classic it has not gone out of fashion. Very beautiful. I kept a lot of what I wore. Laces, simple fabrics, velvet, satin... Do you remember ? You dressed like no one else. You know I like discretion. I asked Mark let Pauline and Uwe be our witnesses. I wanted a very simple civil ceremony. Nervous? Provided that Pauline arrives in time. There it is, I believe. I urgently need... We are waiting for you inside. Wait ! I'm coming ! Paulina, did the sitting go well? We better get in. Why did you do this? I don't know. I don't like to do things by halves. Like getting married? In general. It's not that rare, though. Many prefer to wait before... Garbo also left the bandwagon, who would find fault with it? Your things are here. Don't change your mind. Don't call me and tell me it was a fad. Don't be ridiculous. I'm leaving for Paris with Aaron. I won't call you again. Hold on. Just a moment. Also take ηa. I could kill you for ηa. Here it is. I call the police. Especially not. He is crazy. Violent. I just want to listen to it. He does not enter. Just tell him I'm gone. Talk with him. Should I talk to him? So I open it to him. Certainly not. Who is this ? Open. It's Mark. What do you want at this hour? Speak ΰ Lou. She's not here. Stop it. His car is ahead. Say I'm gone. She doesn't want to talk to you. I have to talk to him. Tell him he disappointed me. She has the Do you beat women? Open the door. If I don't suit him, why continue? I love it. Why, indeed? Ask him. Come on, ask him. I love it. It's true ? You know it well. Come on, open it. Hello, Mark. Thank you for everything Pauline. You know... What a dream! It is... All... what I wanted. However, I can't take it anymore. Do you understand? People leave me alone. You know how to predict the weather without having to go out... That doesn't help you much. I am incoherent. On the contrary. To tell the truth, at a certain time, η was wrong. Was it your illness? That's my problem. It's so boring, so banal, it's the same story for everyone. You were supposed to accompany me to Paris for the collections. Mark stopped me. He threatened me. It's not that, Lou. The magazine wouldn't let me take you. Because I was sick, is that it? They wanted a new face. I had discovered this girl and asked you to teach her how to wear makeup. You were so good. It's true. You know, everything would have been different if I had accompanied you to Paris. It's ΰ this moment that Mark started spying on me. He couldn't stand the mystery of who I was anymore. I was like a prisoner. Especially at night. Lord, it was so sad. He wanted to accompany me everywhere. A little sexier. Warmer... It was driving him crazy. He was threatening to kill himself. To kill me, too. So Lou? A problem? You are cold ? Think ΰ Mark. It was horrible, I had to run away. He shot me down out of play. I held him responsible. Was he there? Who ? Are you talking about Mark? He wasn't there. I never talk about him. He had made advances to me but Pauline blamed me. I was so young. This is where I broke off our engagement. You know I've waited a long time for the day where I would give up the profession for a while. Have a small house. Live... in a state of grace. Write poems, sculpt and paint. Now I'm here. A beautiful place, facing the sea, the boats in the distance... I met a neighbor. She has a lot of hobbies, of collections that occupy it. But there's really only one person, since I've been here, which interested me. Who is this ? The Chinese. It is called as ηa. I christened him Mr. Wong. It rhymed with horizon... Somehow. I was going out and would find him. He spoke bad English, but I made myself understood. When ηa went wrong... No fish today. No, Miss Sand. Maybe it's too isolated here for them? I only had two contracts this week. One with a totally unknown lousy photographer, and with whom I never want to work again. Honey, what do you expect us to do with your list? There are too many people you don't want to work with anymore. Let me see. I didn't write down all those names. It seems to me so. You're crazy, I didn't do that. All right. What should I do ? We remove some... Paulina? It's ridiculous, I never registered Pauline. And Aaron? It is insane. Falcon, no. Never again Falco. But Aaron? I love Aaron. Call him. I'm sure he'll hire me. Are you one of the models? I am Lou Andreas Sand. One of the models? You are an hour early. Nobody is there. I'm early on purpose... - Your name is... - George. Don't tell Aaron I'm here. I have a fantastic silhouette idea, it's a surprise. For what ? Sentimental reasons? Here's T.J. How are you, honey? Pardon. How are you ? What a pleasure ! You're beautiful. I love your makeup. Lovely, all that green. I try it. It suits you very well. Do you know T.J.? We have fantastic dresses! You will love. I'll take ηa... and ηa... and also this one. I can't kill him. I love it. Rather kill me. Fei Ming will shed his blood for the one she loves. Thus, his pitiful torment will end. For the peace of this wretched soul, the souls of his ancestors will burn forever in the flames of dishonor. Know, my daughter, that this story is true. Your mother and your brother, treacherously murdered. But now everything comes back to you. And you ? I, your father, Fu Man Chu, sent you far away, to the West, to preserve you, before being worthy of your respect. Alas, today you are witness to my disgrace. We are of the same blood. I make your hatred mine, your revenge will be mine. Drop everything and stay. If I stay, will I ever have blonde curls, an alabaster skin, like Ronald? I prefer yours... I'll never forget... Hello, Mark. How are you ? I'm doing well. I'm doing fine, you know. It's good. Do you feel it in my voice? I took no medicine, no wine, no nothing. I am at home, alone, I'm watching a hilarious movie. Who knows if it will last... I have someone at home. It is not the moment. Who is this ? I thought we knew each other, maybe. I would have asked you to pass the good evening. They replace me, and no one notices. It's true ! Do you want to come? No. I would like to see you. It's not true. You just don't want to be alone. It's not true. She's a model? I will hang up. Maybe there is no one you want to provoke me. Do you watch television? There's this hilarious movie, with Anna May Wong. I read that she thought that each new image of her stole a bit of her soul. Isn't it fun? I told you... I haven't slept all week. Do you know that I can't sleep anymore? I can't do anything for you. what you should do, it's going to see a doctor. Thank you really. Can I speak to Dr. Galba? It's me, it's Uwe. What is going on ? What happens to you ? I'm sorry... I wake you up? It's nothing. What is it ? Tell me. I woke you up? I told you, it's nothing. I'm coming. I feel very... evil. Here you are. Thank you for coming. I left immediately. I thought you were sick. A bit of rosé? I wanted to see you. So everything's OK ? You looked so distressed. When I want to see someone I really want it. Is it so bad? It was just a little late. But no, Uwe. It's still early. With your pills you should avoid. Dance with Me. I didn't come to dance! Why then ? I'm a woman. What's wrong? I came to help you. Please. Please stop. No one will know. No one will ever know. Why are you doing this? I like you... But no, you don't love me. If I love you. listen. You recognize me ? It's me... Uwe. I am not... that a man. "Suddenly appears "on front of me "The only one I want "take in my arms..." Listen, you're sick. Make me love! I do not know you ! Please... Don't do that... Don't tell anyone. No, of course. But if ηa is known, and we ask you, tell them that I had an empty passage ΰ. That I am well cared for. Of course. I am undernourished. We have to eat ! Do you realize they don't give a knife? I told them : "A private room at this price, "and I am not entitled to a knife!" Nothing personal, that's the rule. I take it personally. I like being trusted. I could jump out the window. Have you tried? Want me to try? I can. Right away. Very spiritual. Nothing personal. They are all like ηa here. Want to jump? When I want to end I could easily do that. What are you writing? I'm only here for a reason get stamps. I didn't come in drooling, or pulling my hair out, but walking, calmly. Forgot your hustle? Dr. Sherman is my psychiatrist. He's the boss here. If you don't leave, I'm going to start getting very agitated. What are you writing, Lou? Poetry. I can see ? What is it talking about? it speaks from my experiences. Are you reading it to me? It's not over. Do you know what the other doctor said? "Everyone on this floor thinks you're weird." "Sorry", I said, "but I don't care what they think of me." NOW, do what feels right to you. I want you to be happy and ΰ comfortable with us. Excuse my sloppy appearance. You are lovely. But tell me, how do you feel? A little exhausted by my efforts to please you. And Aaron's visit? It was so sad. He has so much remorse. He knows he should have taken me to Paris. He told me : "Let's give ourselves another chance." I said... He said... Forgive me for leaving you. Never mind. Never mind. Sit down. Do not be sad. I won't stay here long. Dr. Sherman says... that it must first have been broken to can rebuild, better. But if they ask you, tell them it's my metabolism. It's true, by the way. I don't feel fit. I'm awful... No way. Do you know why we stay here? Dr. Sherman and I are here to throw them all out the door. I told the doctors. I hear them behind the walls. They denied. "You are delirious, we put you on the 2nd floor." And me: "What are you doing? Call my doctor." And he told me... You are right. They talk about you. I find her as sexy as canned tuna. She was so good. She should have been lucid and enjoyed it like us. She made advances to him! Ida Saints Berry adored him. She's a liar. I find it annoying. I will never hire him again. They take our matches. Request ΰ this internal. You see, you were right. They speak well of you. That is what I thought. So let's go to the 2nd. No one will bother us. They will be bored. I'm upstairs, like a prisoner in solitary confinement. But you know, I know... that it was all in my head. Of course. Because Pauline sent me flowers, and Peggy, a card wishing me a good recovery. How nice. It was all in my head. That's all. And you know, it's so awful here, that I already feel much better than before. It shows. And you know what ? What ? Now... things will change. I really try... to go well. I really have to work on it. I shouldn't be so inert. We have finished ? Yes. Otherwise I will miss the last ferry. It would be awful. Your wife would ask questions. "Where's Aaron?" You showed me, Rhinehardt. Put it in your movie. You made me see it too. That's it, friends. I had to play the recorder... Soprano, bass, my... my castanets! Ηa will have to wait for the next time. Have you ever heard my castanets? Yes. I remember. It was bad, is not it ? How I loved the great outdoors, little one! I left my family behind to run in the hills! I've never been happier than when I hit rock bottom. It's true. For what ? I don't know. I have always been a recluse. One thing remains intriguing. Not for you ? What ? Knowing how much you counted in my life... We commune in work, don't we? It's true. It's funny, to have spent so much time together, all these years, and with so many occasions, in a way. It would have been so simple, and it's so common... With what they said about you... These two models for example, one thought she was pregnant, the other told you... like a horse. That doesn't prove anything... I was there with you almost constantly... and nothing. We never had... of history. Isn't that crazy? Probably my fault. Averell Quinn was crazy about me. There was Mark. Arthur Jeaster wanted a divorce. Falcon... He had made a hole through which he was watching me! There was Pauline and Dr. Galba. I am... I really wonder why was it like that with you, and why I imagined that... Finally, I concluded... that you don't find me attractive. It's not true. But it's fun, right? That we never... But yes, Lou. What ? It happened. Really ? Yes. It will go. It will go. Everything was so confused. I thought... having imagined it. I didn't imagine it? No. It didn't last. I did not imagine it... I have to go. I was... up to it? Of course, Lou. God be praised...
