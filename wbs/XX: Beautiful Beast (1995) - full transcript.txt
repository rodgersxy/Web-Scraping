C'mon! We've got to hurry! Where are we?! Not far from lshignkl Airport. Really. I don't do it as much anymore. Once or twice a week, If I'm lucky. What about you?! It's hardly anything to brag about. I know about you. To have sex, you at least have to know someone to do It with. Know someone, huh. But these days, young people don't fuck every day. Not true In your league though, I bet. You're wrong about that. Really. The other day one of my guys told me he found a new girlfriend, but even so... This soup's practically cold, Wench! What the hell's going on here?! Motherfucker! Don't shoot! What's going on?! - XX Utsukushikl Kemono ~ XX BEAUTIFUL BEAST SHIMAIIURA Kaorl YAMATO Takeshl Hakuryu KIKUOHI Takanorl KATAGIRI Yuko HAYAKAWA Yuzo IKEDA Toshlharu Somebody out there? Whafre you doing? You alright? You're hurt... You guys go that way! Don't let her get away! Hurry! Como Inside. Understand? You speak Japanese? Boss, the cops are here. How dare you let this happen on a night when I'm on duty. Hey, It wasn't like we instigated this. Just one shot? So who did It? Everyone who was with the boss got Iced. There are no eye witnesses. Yaguchfl Your punks have been tearing around Kabuki-cho like wild dogs! They wouldn't be If they didn't know who you were after! Officer. I wouldn't be sitting here with my thumb up my ass if I knew who did it. Got a high pain threshold. There, all done. It's you... Fujlnaml... I'm closed for the night. We're looking for a Chinese woman. Can we look around your bar here? I'm closed for the night. You prick! Zip It. If you come across this Chinese woman, give us a call would you? Sure thing. Move It. - Right Boss. You're sure In trouble. You should stay put here for a while. I feel so hot... Don't tell me this was your way of saying thanks. You're a strange woman. What's your name? Rin- Ran, ls It? My name's... I know. Fujlnaml. The yakuza called you that. Are you yakuza, too? NO. I can't stand the yakuza, Oh? Glad to hear It. You speak Japanese well. My mother's Japanese. Hey, the yakuza will still be looking around out there. I'm okay. Thanks, Mr. Fujlnaml. Yolchl. Everyone who's close to me calls me Yolchl. Then goodbye, Yolchl. Did you hear about lshizuka? What do you think? That the boss was old. Is that all? Yeah, pretty much. A waitress ran off from the scene. She's Chinese. I feel so hot... That Chinese woman Is our one and only lead. The Talselkal gang is out looking all over for her, too. You'll let me know If you hear anything, won't you? Why are you asking me? Because you're the only one Yaguchl fully trusts, In the end. I'm not yakuza, You left the yakuza, but you can never fully leave your past behind. Isn't that so? I'm not so sure. I'm meeting Ho here. Yaguchl? He'll see you alone, okay? Fine. Ho says It might be the Pasel Ding. Pasel? What the hell Is that? The most dangerous underground gang... In all of Hong Kong. Pasel Ding, or the Untouchables'. These guys won't die even If you shoot them. They were Red Guards, and were also In the army. They've seen a lot of action. They know how to handle guns and explosives. They'll take on any job, no matter how dangerous. They say a woman killed him. There's a female fighter In the Pasel Ding. Called 'Ran', or the Black Orchid. She was a guerrilla in Afghanistan until recently. The Black Orchid... Congratulations, Yaguchl. On becoming the gang boss. Mr. Ho. The only way for me to become the gang boss ls to flush out... the woman who did It and blow her away! It's not difficult to find someone who can got in touch with the Pasel Ding. I'll put the word out. Good work. Take that table. Welcome to the club! I'm Chan Li. Let's have a good time. Let's got a hotel room! Are you drunk already? You okay? What am I supposed to do?! My visa': up and I have to go home soonl? Bastard! Shut up you goddamn skag! Have you gotten used to this type of work, Ran? You won't make any money unless you start taking clients. Are you sending money back to your family? No, I'm not. Oh, well In that case... you don't need to take a bunch of clients against your will. My case is a bit different. My parents are walling for me to send money each month. But a big portion of the money goes to my loan from the snakehead... so I can'! send my parents much. How much ls your loan? Two million yon. It's gonna take me another two years to pay It oft. A woman from my village came back from Japan just loaded with money. She rented the entire Shanghai Hotel and held this huge party. That's how I met my snakehead. He told me I could have this great life if I came to Japan. So I borrowed a bunch of money from my relatives and came to Japan. I never imagined that I'd have to lick the private parts of Japanese men... in order to make money. Anyway, I'm gonna have a great big party too, once I get back to the village. I'll invite everyone from the village, and hold a huge feast! Sound good, Ran? Let's got going. Look. It's morning again. Now it's our free time again, until night. It's almost the end of the month. I hate nights at the end of the month. Why's that? Because the Mafia comes. The end of the month is payday. They make us go to hotel rooms. You were an Informant for the Pasel Ding In Hong Kong. You know the Black Orchid, don't you! Yeah. She's In Japan, Isn't she! Who hired her?! I don't know who hired her... honest! I didn't even know she was In Japan! She came to see me out of the blue, about a month ago. She was asking about two men. Two men? What men? Ishlzuka, president of the Talselkal. And Mr. Ho. You! The Black Orchid said she wanted information on the two of you. What the hell?! What does It mean?! Why?! I don't know, I don't know! My job's just to get paid for giving out Information. I don't know a thing. Who the hell's this 'Black Orchid' woman?! Don't you have a photo?! A photo of someone in the Pasel Ding? If you had something like that, you'd regret you ever lived. What did you tell her about me? The address of your condo. The club you run. That you have three women, and sometimes shy overnight at their places. So I told her their addresses, too. She's after me? Ran? Yolchl? You sure disappeared into thin air! The boss of a yakuza group called the Talseikal was murdered. They're searching everywhere for a Chinese woman who saw it happen. Ran, yakuza who've had their boss killed... They're like a pack of hungry wolves. I'm not scared of the yakuza, You should be! I don't wanna talk about this. You smell good. I'm all sweaty. No. You smell like 'Roi Fa'. What? Rel Fa. Pear blossoms. Rel Fa. Beautiful name for a flower. There are lots of pear trees In China. They'd be In full blossom right about now. Rel Fa was my little sister's favourite flower. Your little sister? Is she in Japan as well? She's dead. Rin- Stay here with me. I'd like to stay. But I can't. Got work to do. On the left ls a female fingerprint we pulled from the crime scene... where the Taleelkal president was murdered. The print on the right is that of a woman who assassinated a politician... In central Hong Kong... along with all the cops who were in the immediate vicinity. So the killer Is the assassin, the Black Orchid. She doesn't hesitate to leave her fingerprints all over the scene... meaning she doesn't even take the cops into consideration. So some gang summoned the Black Orchid from Hong Kong... and hired her to kill lshizuka. Perhaps not. She might have had a personal vendetta. A vendetta? Who's this? Six months ago, in a twelve-story apartment building... a Chinese club hostess named Clm Kan was discovered, out down. Her body was sent back to Hong Kong even though the perp wasn't found. But In Hong Kong, the rumor was that she's Black Orohlcfs younger ulster. Her little sister?! Are you suggesting she came to get revenge for her little sister?! Chu Kan, a so-called 'hostess', worked at a club run by the Taiseikai. If this murdered Ohu Kan turns out to be the Black 0rchid's little sister... then it's going to mean big trouble. It won't end quietly. Hey, take a hike. Good evening! That girl over there's new. She's a real stick In the mud. Call her over for a bit. Sure. Know who I am? The manager's boyfriend. A scary guy. I'm not especially scary. Have a seat. After the club closes down, you're coming to a hotel with me. Alright? Alright. Drink It. Ever see a chicken get killed? NO. You hold its neck and body still like this. Pretty scary. Then you give It one good, hard twist. Then the bright red comb starts shaking like jelly. Poor thing. You can't kill It outright though. Otherwise the meat will get tough. I like eating chicken. Mind If I use the ladies' room? Do It here. Don't be shy! This ls my club. Do It. My feet are soaked. Throw It here. Chan LI! Where am I? My room. What exactly are you, anyway?! You're better off not knowing. Get some sleep. Will you stay here by me? Okay, I will. But get some sleep. Get anything? No, not yet. Get a bloody move on! Yes sir! Some guys from the Talselkal were here around dawn. They were asking where two women, Ran and Chan LI, had gone. When they said they didn't know, they started roughing the women up. 'Ran'? You mean the Black Orchid? They say she hangs out with this Ohun LI. Hey brunette, come here! Is Chun Ll this woman here? Hey! Put her on the wanted list! Ra"! We caught that 0mm Ll skunk! The stupid cow went back to her apartment to get her money! I'll round up some men. Yaguchi, let us finish off the Black Orchid. Oh no, you won't! We're taking down the Black Orchid, for what she did to the boss! So don't go getting any Ideas! Think you guys can handle her?! We'll send out our own men, too! Ho wants to meet you. Yeah? Tonight, at twelve, at the Balkan Wharf. We'll give that Chan Li chick back to you then. Long time, Yolchl? Yeah. I know... you don't let yakuza In here. But this ls the last time. I won't show my face again. I don't like the sound of that. I'm sure you didn't come here to tell mo that. We found out who killed the boss. She's called the Black Orchid. An assassin from Hong Kong. But as It turns out, no matter how many men we send out... we come up pretty much empty-handed. So... I asked the Taiwan Mafia to find her. Pretty Impressive. No wonder you're the No. 2 man for the Talselkal. That's a smart plan you've come up with. Nothing smart about It. Even you know that the Taiwan Mafia are indiscriminate, right? But the truth is... we can't just kill her outright. Someone hired the bitch! If I don't get the assassin to tell me who it was, and kill them... I won't be able to hold my head up on the streets of Kabuki anymore! You understand, right? Yolchl. I really need your help here. Okay? Listen, I'm not yakuza anymore. Yolchl, you haven't forgotten, have you? Got him! You got him! You got him! You got him! Yoichl! Let's got outta here! Yoichi! Give me the rifle! I'll say I shot him! You 're hurt, you can't escape! It'll be to my advantage even if the cops catch me! I'll get promoted! Gimme the rifle! I blew your gang boss away! It's been five years since then. You've become a clean man. But whether you're a yakuza or not, you have to return a favour. All you have to dole keep her from getting away. We'll take it from there. Yolchl. I need you. Understand? Ho... Get over here! Move! Come out, Black Orchid! Come out, or we'll kill her! Ra"! I feel so hot... Yaguchl, get outta there! What's that? Mo, you're not Ho. Boss! Boss! Yaguchfl Boss! Boss! Ran! Ran! Show yourself, Black Orchid! We'll kill her! Drop the gun and come out! Ra"! Chun Ll! Run! Get in, Chun LII Where's Ho? I dunno. I haven't seen him since we got here! Then I don't need to be here. Yolchl? Shoot her, Yoichi! That's her! That's the Black Orchid! What the hell are you doing Yolchl?! Shoot her! Shoot her! Ra"! Chun Ll... why? I can make some money if I kill you! You don't mean! The Mafia boss promised mo! That he'd pay me a lot of money! And give back my passport! I'll be able to go back to my village... and have that big party. You kill people for money too, right? So what's wrong with me doing the same thing? Chun LI! Chan LI! Ho! Black Orchid. You've got a lot of vulnerable points. Think so? You won't shoot now. I'll just wait for my men to show up. Whafro you gonna do? Listen, Ho. If you shoot mo, Ran's gonna shoot you. We'll see. I'm not so sure she has It In her. Wanna watch and find out? Alright! Are you game? Ran, just go ahead and shoot me. Ran, over here! Yolchl. Yeah? How're you connected to the yakuza? With fetters, I guess. With fetters? Yeah. Yaguchl and I got our first hooker together. We broke the Windshields of guys In a rival gang. We were shaking in our boots. We used to blow all our money gambling... than share a bowl of noodles at the roadside stand. We're bound to each other. Are you still bound, even now? No, I guess not. Where are you going now? Kabuki-cho. It'll be crawling with yakuza! Ho's still alive. I hear you. Yolchl. Promise me you won't Interfere, when we come across Ho again. Why?! That man Isn't human. Hey, Ran. If I hadn't]umped outta the way back there, would you have shot? Forget It; I don't wanna know. I know what kind of woman you are. Here, gimme a hand with this stuff. My client and I are done hero. What's in there? That room's empty. But someone seems to be using It recently. It's nothing to write home about. I'm just not the cooking type. Oh yeah, that's right. You need passports, don't you? I know a guy In the fake passport business, so I'll ask for you. He'll be In the yakuza, so It won't work. Oh, yeah... I sure am stupid! Sorry about that. Don't worry about It. Because I really am stupid. You're infatuated with her. I can tell. Whafre you talking about? You're still a full-blooded man. You like to get your fill of danger. Get off my case. Let's see your wound. This Is the second time you've treated my wounds. Yolchl. What Is It? They're here. Black Orchid. Come out. No. This ls my war. Yolchl! Run for It! Hurry and go! Move It! Black Orchid... If I twist this sword out, he's a dead man! Get outta here, Ran! I know the Black Orchid a lot better than you do. We're only just getting started. Stick out your tongue and lick it. It's my penis. Take it Inside you. You really think you forced me to come here? So this is how my sister died. I finally figured out why my little sister's genitals were butchered. What are you talking about? Six months ago, you and lshizuka had a little party. You called in some women and were living it up. One of those women was from Hong Kong. Her name was Chu Kan. She came back to Hong Kong as e butchered corpse. I remember now. She was cute, with fair skin. Chu Kan was my little sister. 0h yeah? So that's what this ls all about. Well In that case, Black Orchid... I'll kill you to boot! Shoot her! Kill the bitch. Not you again. We can't find Ho. He's disappeared. Then ask Yaguchl. Yaguchfs disappeared too. I'd like to know where they are myself. Up until three days ago, I was practically on my deathbed! Hey, Fujinaml. Where's the Black Orchid? Couldn't tell ya. You! You wanna know where Yaguchl ls. What's wrong? Look at that guy. Yolchl! Where's Ho? Don't! I knew a man who could stand It up to the third finger. He went insane on his fourth. I'll tell you, I'll tell you! Ho's In a summer house In Chiba that our gang uses for smuggling! Yolchl, do you know where It ls? Yeah. Rin- Why'd you kill Yaguchi?! If I hadn't killed him, he would've killed me. I don't wanna wait until sunrise. Let's get It over with. No, Yolchl. Why not? Because you'll slow me down. Think I'm stupid enough to bust Into that house prepared to die? If I use this, I could wipe out everyone In the house... no matter how many there were. Don't you understand, Yolchl? I'm not a romantic. I'm not such an idiot that I'd give up my life in exchange... for the lives of those Taiwan Mafia punks. The reason I want to wait until sunrise... ls so that I can get a good look at him In his death throes. I'm sure my little sister wants to, as well. How long are you gonna let this go on for?! I don't know myself. But I don't think it'll be forever. It won't end until someone kills you! Don't you get it?! Yolchl. What do you want from me? Will you hold mo? I wanna sleep until morning. And lfeel like I could fall asleep, if I were in your arms. Can I? Yolchl. Do Tzue. What the hell happened hero? Vice Squad, go to the second floor! I'll take the first floor! Fujlnaml. What happened to Ho? He got half his face blown off. Where's the Black Orchid? Guess she took off. Gone back to Hong Kong? Who knows? But there's no point going after her. You'll never catch her. You didn't go with her? I couldn't go. If I'd gone with her, I'd have to watch her get killed sooner or later. I couldn't see the woman I'd fallen for got killed. The last thing she said to me was 'Do Tzue', Do you know what It moans? Do Tzue? Yeah, It means, 'I'm grateful'. Grateful? Seems like something she'd say. Subtitled by Marukomu
