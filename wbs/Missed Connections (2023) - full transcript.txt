[theme music] LOOKING FOR SOMEONE I'VE BUMPED INTO. IS IT JUST ME, OR WAS THERE SOMETHING? NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, I'LL BE TWO STEPS BEHIND. TO MY LRT SEATMATE. YOU GOT OFF AT SANTOLAN. YOUR ELBOW HURT ME, BUT IT'S OKAY. I HOPE YOU NUDGE ME AGAIN. Yeah. - Smells nice? - Mm, yeah. [phone ringing and vibrating] Here we go again. [breathes deeply] [phone key beeps] Hello, sir. [client] I keep sending messages through your website, but there's no reply. Uh, sir, we're in the process of redesigning our website, but we already started making the T-shirts for your order. Don't worry. Just be patient with us, please. [client] I've been checking up on it for two weeks now. This has been botched from the beginning. What are you gonna do for me? Yes, of course, sir. We're so sorry. Look, just forget it. If this is your idea of good customer service, how do you stay in business? We will figure it out, sir. - God, don't bother! Just cancel... - All right, then! Fine. Whatever. Cancel. See if I care. Not like you're a big loss. - [groans] - [phone key clacks] Not a big loss... That was your only order this whole month, Mae. What the heck? [dramatic music] [Mae sighs] Can I have one of those? These sardines are so lucky. Crammed in this can together. They're all cozy. And at least they're not alone, you know. Hey, give me a new one. This one will expire soon. But, uh, they're all the same. Oh, okay. Thank you. [gasps] [Mae giggles] Sorry. I thought you were a guy who worked here. Well, the shelf was, uh, disorganized so I fixed it. [whimsical music] [chuckles] Wow. [cash register beeping] [cashier] Fifteen hundred pesos, please. This isn't mine. [chuckles] That's mine. Oh, sorry, ma'am. I've already scanned it. I thought you two were together, the way you were looking at him. [cashier] Sorry, sir. The manager will come and void the transaction. Uh... No, it's okay. It's my treat. Really? Well, this is awkward. Oh, I'm sorry. - Hang on. 1,500. - Thank you very much. - Um, this is so embarrassing. - [cashier] This is your receipt. Hang on, one sec... Let me pay you back. You probably think I'm a scam artist, but it really was an accident, you know. Here... Can we make this fast? Where is Mr. Green? [cheerful music] MISSED CONNECTIONS HELLO, GINGERHEAD! LOOKING FOR MR. GREEN Thanks for the muffin. And... hi! LOOKING FOR MR. GREEN [giggling] MAYBE THIS TIME Oh! Mae! - [Mae] What is that? - Look at this. Look at this. Look at this, look at this! - [Mae] So many likes! - [Auntie] Hundred thousand views! [Mae] Auntie, you're famous! [Auntie] It's obviously because my plants are gorgeous. That's what the viewers are looking at. - Ooh, yeah. They are. - And I'm not too bad-looking either. I don't know, Auntie. But, you know what? You're incredible. Besides, I'm a bit envious because you figured out what to do with your life. Every morning you wake up, and you know exactly what needs to get done. Some of the people I know have already figured out what to do with their lives. Whereas, I haven't got a clue what to do with my life. MISSED CONNECTIONS HELLO, GINGERHEAD! LOOKING FOR GROCERY GIRL - Auntie! - What the heck's wrong? - Don't scare me like that. - Auntie! Auntie! This is what I've been talking about. Auntie, look. It's him! I knew it. It wasn't just in my head. We both felt the connection. He's looking for you? Are you sure? Come on, you're overthinking. - Of course it's me. - But... Let's read it together. "White shirt." White shirt. "Tote Bag. Grocery Bag." That's totally me! I got to answer. What should I write? It's good to see you've forgotten about Mark. [Auntie] Are you still upset about him? Who, Mark? Yeah. Well, no. It's just he broke my heart, you know. If I remember correctly, you, too, were a hot mess when you got your heart broken. Uh, Michael Angelo? I have to admit, that one really hurt. My one true love. My greatest love. I just knew it wasn't gonna work. I didn't wanna move to Holland. He wanted us to live there but not me. And that was just a deal breaker. In the end, you see, neither of us would've been happy. But, Auntie, it's been haunting you forever. Every time you tell the story, I can actually feel your pain. Even if it's all in the past, I know it still hurts you. [Mae] Oh, no. I still haven't unfollowed him. Really? So Mark is still active, huh? [Auntie] Well, he sure is good at expressing his love. They'll break up soon, you'll see. You know what Mark's favorite saying is? "Nothing lasts forever. Everything must come to an end." Why does this still bother you? - It doesn't bother me. - You're so in denial, girl. Excuse me, but, you are wrong. But you do have a point. It's true that, uh, you can't go against your basic values, Mm-hm. But I wonder if I tried more, maybe we'd still be together. Okay, this is what matters now. I've got to say something good. [Mae squeals] Come on, Auntie! Help me out. You sure you're the one he's referring to? You betcha! [cheerful music] YOU DESTINED AND FATED There. Isn't it pretty? It's so cute, huh? So nice. "Destined to meet." There. Very well said. [phone chimes] [whimsical music] MISSED CONNECTIONS CHAT HOW CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE GROCERY GIRL? FACT CHECK. WHAT TIME WERE YOU AT THE GROCERY?

[phone keys clacking] Norman... Hm. "Web designer. Gamer. Cosplay geek." - [Mae] Mark! What the hell? - So... His name's Norman, huh? Good looking. I bet he'll ditch you too. Please, Mark. [sighs] Why do you want a boyfriend so bad? Don't you like me anymore? [gasps] We broke up ages ago. Ouch! That hurts! [sighs] Hey. You jealous? Reality check, all right? Do you really think he's gonna like you? And look at all this mess. A disaster. Your business is a flop. You're not selling anything. Your ideas lead absolutely nowhere. - You're hopeless. - Hey, enough! I'm not asking for your opinion, okay? [grunts] [sighs] I just want to fall in love. But I can't find anyone worth falling in love with. [phone keys clacking] [whimsical music] GINGERHEAD I'M MAE. [camera shutter clicks] ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW? CAN WE MEET? DESTINED AND FATED [romantic music] Waiter. Uh... it's a bit dirty. Could you bring me a new one? [waiter] Yeah, sure. Thank you. [whimsical music] [giggling] What a coincidence. Mm, it is you. Hello. Hello, Mr. Green. [Mae giggles] Hi? "Hi?" You can stop now. I posted something about you. You posted something about me. So, I think you can stop pretending now. [chuckles awkwardly] Sorry. I'm waiting for someone. This seat's taken. Oh. Okay, sorry. Oh, come on. It's me! [Mae] Stop pretending! It's me. Grocery Girl. Huh? [clicks tongue] Yesterday, you treated me to a muffin, remember? [Mae] You posted, and now you pretend not to know me. [groans] No, no, no. This isn't right. - I texted you? - Yes. The smiley face with the, uh... Why? What's wrong? Oh, no. I'm not the one you're looking for? I'm sorry. [groans] This is cringe. Um... But the description you were giving in your post, "Grocery Girl," white shirt with a grocery bag. Uh... a bag and, uh... a tote bag. It's the same bag I had yesterday. Oh, boy. I'm so sorry. Um, this is awkward But it's okay. Um... Now, this won't be a waste of your time because I'll pay you back. Here. [cheerful music] - There. We're all good now. - It's fine. Wait. Hey! [sighs] How do we, uh, leave a review for Missed Connections? Huh? It's the app's fault really. There should be a disclaimer that says, "Success not guaranteed." But it did work. [sighs] Uh... Well, uh... Uh, how about we order? Apparently, the, uh, food is really good. [lively music] [Norman] Really? Really. I designed those shirts. You don't look like a T-shirt designer to me. What do you know, huh? Oh, but your sales aren't that great. Exactly. You know, your T-shirt designs are actually pretty good. Yeah, I'd buy one. Here. Maybe this one right here. Here, look. That's nice of you. [clears throat] But one thing that would really help you is a better-looking website. Huh. Well, I built it and maintain it myself. I can't afford monthly subscriptions for professional sites. They cost a lot. But it wouldn't be too hard to optimize it. Especially for retail. All you really need is a T-shirt collection gallery, FAQs, order status... And then, you can add a bunch of testimonials. That's it. Wow, you're cute and smart. [chuckles] Yeah, well, that's my job. I build sites for B2B and B2C. You code? I code. Java, Python... Been at it for five years now. [chuckles] You know what... I've been looking for someone to, um... to redesign my website. Um, a web developer with more than five years of experience. Can I hire you? - [both chuckle] - Sorry. This is turning into a job opportunity. What kind of budget do you have? Twenty five hundred pesos. [whimsical music] [sighs] That might be why we were destined to meet. Hm, maybe. [Norman] Sure. Really? You'll do it? Deal. [giggling] Deal. - Deal, my almost missed connection. - Missed connection. - Oh, come on! - [chuckles] We said it at the same time. [whimsical music] Does it have to be at your house? Oh, it's not far. One street over. I think it'd be best if you sent me the details. Everything's at my house. That'll save us a lot of trouble. Well, why don't you just send me an email? Product images, design samples? But it's much better if you see them for real. And, uh, my Internet's very fast. [siren wailing in distance] First time I, uh... "First time"? First time going to... First time... Ah! First time going into a girl's place? [chuckles] But you don't even know me. I could be some kind of whack job. With that face of yours? I don't think you are. And you? [gasps] What do you want? [groans] [Mae] University ID. Same name. Same address I gave out. And my... postal ID. They both show the same thing. The name is the same. Uh... - But you look a bit... - Hey! These are from five years ago, come on. Here's my ID. Just in case. You look kinda cute. On your picture. What do you say? Are we good now? Yeah. Okay, let's go. [sighs] [cheerful music] - You can walk a little closer, you know. - No, no. It's fine. I'm okay. Here we are. Come on in. So this is where I live. My office is over there. Please excuse the, uh, clutter. Creative. - You live here by yourself? - Uh, I live alone. Yes. But, uh... I'm looking for a partner, if you're interested. For, uh... for my business, I mean. Come on, what were you thinking? [Mae] Uh, come. You can sit over here. Uh... Sorry for the mess. [sighs] Here we go. [exhales] Okay. Okay. Here I was thinking I was gonna meet someone, but now, I'm working. Well, it can be both. [Norman chuckles] [giggles] [keyboard clacking] [Mae] I'll make it up to you. I can cook, you know. What do you like? Uh... you. Uh, me? Yeah, whatever you like. [chuckles awkwardly] [chuckles] Okay. [quirky music] [Mae] Oh! Where's the salt? I know I have some somewhere! Shit. Shit, shit. Mm... Burnt eggs smell so good! I can tell where this is going. Heartbreak. Crying like a baby all by yourself. What you mean to say is, happiness and deep true love. [snickers] [slurps] I don't understand why you try so hard. We both know he's gonna end up leaving you. Hm? Mark. Hm? - Mark. - Yes? - Let me tell you something. - Hm? The only person I want to see the back of... Who? Is you. Give me that. Hey! What are you doing? That's my coffee! [breathes deeply] [quirky music] This is for you. [chuckles] That'll give you energy. [quirky music] [sighs] - Mae? - Hm? This isn't gonna work. - Why? Is something wrong? - [insect buzzing] Do you want to talk about the rate? Uh... You don't like this? What? Tell me what you need. [insect buzzing] What I need? I need... I need a clean dish. Mosquito. [cheerful music] [Mark] Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae! [Mae] What? He's no lazy boy. Look at him go. Wait, wait. He's throwing away Mr. Bear! I-I gave that to you for your birthday. Quick, quick! Stop him! - [Mae shushes] - Come on! [sighs] [Norman] What's with all the stuff, anyway? Things hold memories only the owner can see. [Norman sighs] And this? What's the story? That... My dad gave that to me before he... My mother absolutely loves flowers. Everyday, she would bring home different kinds of flowers and, uh... she would put them in there. I don't like throwing things away. I like to know that those things are there in case I need them. I want them here. [sniffs] That way, I feel like they're close to me. And never feel alone. Because if the thing is still here, it means they are too. And I can smell their love. [whimsical music] - [sniffs] - So how did you end up designing T-shirts? The things I have trouble expressing, I put on a T-shirt. [Mae chuckles] And you? What's with that? This? I've had it for five years. I got it when I was 20 years old. It was a present from my father before he left for Saudi Arabia. It's meant to remind me to make time for the important things in life. Things like family. But, uh... [chuckles] ...I really do try to make time for them. It's just hard, you know. Then we both have things that we're unable to let go of. Seems like it. [chuckles] You sure know how to tidy up the house. [chuckles] [sighs] Yes, thank you. I'm also good at cooking and doing laundry. I find that hard to believe. [grunts] - Mae. - Hm? Maybe I'll start on your website tomorrow. - It's getting late. - Oh, of course. Whatever you want. So you'll be back tomorrow? [Norman grunts] I'll be back tomorrow, yes. What if you can't finish it tomorrow? I'll finish it the day after. Well, what if it's still not done the day after? Well, there's no rush. Okay. Take care. [door closes] [upbeat music] [camera shutter clicking] AWESOME - Don't move too much. - Okay. Yeah, that's it. [Mae] Slightly to the right. - Like this? - A bit more. - [Mae] There, perfect! - [camera shutter clicks] - This okay? - Here. Here. Look here. Over here. - Hey, why am I in it? - You're not. Don't worry. [chuckles] [Mae] All right, next one. - "Suitable." - Right. "Suitable." Uh, that'll work. [chuckles] - [camera shutter clicks] - [Mae] Look at the camera and smile. Huh? The T-shirt, not you. You look like you want to be in the picture. All right. - One, two, three, smile. - No, I don't wanna be in it. - Come on, don't be shy. You look great. - Come on, you're selling T-shirts. - Smile. One, two... - You don't need me in the shot. Cute. The shirt. - Okay. - Right. Next shirt, please. Okay. I noticed that a lot of your designs are one single word. [Mae] Mm-hm. Yeah. When you wanna say something, the fewer words you use, - the stronger the message. - Mm-hm. No matter how many words people use to express themselves, ultimately, they just wanna say one thing. "Hopefully." "You." "Tomorrow." "Tomorrow." "You." "Hopefully." [Mae] I hope I see you tomorrow. [chuckles] Sorry. You know how you can make your company stand out even more, call it... One Word Shirts. "One Word Shirts." That's great. You... Grateful. [chuckles] Awesome. [chuckles] - Desire. - Hm? That's one word. [Mae chuckles] [whimsical music] - [cat meows] - [Norman gasps] Oops, sorry. It's just my cat. [Mark snickers] [gasps] You're a mess. [snickers] [dramatic music] [sniffs] [sniffing] Oh, my goodness. He's so cute. [sighs] [Mark yawns] Hey, opportunist! [Mark] You're taking advantage of him. [shushes] [Mae] Be quiet. You might wake him up. You really have no shame. Are you sure he's gonna love you back? When I tell him how I really feel about him, I'm sure he'll say he feels the same about me. And once we know how much we love each other... [thumps] ...that'll be it. He's so close. Why on earth would I let him go? That's what you told me too and look at us now. Hey, hey, hey! [Mark] All right, fine! I'll help you with Norman. Norman! Mae's about to tell you - how she feels about you. - [shushes] Would you be quiet? Did I say I was gonna do it right this minute? No, wait. I'm not ready yet. When will you be? When he's gone? [Mae] Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Timing is everything. It'll be the right time soon. [whimsical music] Watch it, that's harassment. Okay, okay. I'm going. [cheerful music] TEASE [keyboard clacking] [Norman] There. [sighs] And we're done. Look. - Wow. - You like it? You did all that? [Mae] It looks awesome! Sorry. Thank you, Norman. It looks great. I'm sure this is, uh... gonna help with your sales. The truth is... I had almost given up on the business. I had reached a point where I, uh... had no clue what I was supposed to do. Well, I'm sure you can do it. Don't give up. [whimsical music] Thank you. No. Thank you. It was a great opportunity. I really enjoyed doing it. For real. [Mark] Psst. Psst, psst. Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae! So, what now? He's finished your website. Now is your chance to tell him how you feel. What are you waiting for? Just say, "Norman, I love you. Let's hang out." The end. I'm telling you. [romantic music] Norman. Um, so, uh... what's the next step for us? [exhales heavily] I know we don't know each other very well yet. But I just... [chuckles] I'd really like to know in which direction we're headed. And, um... I wanna tell you... I think you're special and I have feelings for you. Mae. Yes? Um... I told you... I was going to help you start. Right. But... you're gonna have to take it from here. Hm? Maybe the next thing you should be thinking about is... marketing or... Ah... [Norman] Well... Ah... [exhales] Sorry. Mae... the... the truth is... I'm still not ready for those kinds of things. I'm just beginning to do things for myself. And also... about my missed connection... - I still want to explore that. - Which missed connection? Grocery Girl. [Norman] She replied to my post. Can you believe it? It's been a while, but she still saw it. So you mean, the original Grocery Girl? - Great, right? - [Mae chuckles] [solemn music] I mean it, Mae. Really. I truly enjoyed working with you. Friends? "Friends"? Auntie, think about it for a second. He said he enjoyed working with me, but as friends? And he still got his heart set on this missed connection. I don't get it, Auntie. I really don't. Listen, Mae. If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. End of story. Moving on. Next. See ya. It's not about saying "moving on," or "see ya." The thing with Norman and I, it's like, it can be, but... but just not right now. Or maybe, it could've been, but not really. That's an option too. Auntie! - You're really not helping, you know that. - Okay. Well, think about it. No matter how hard you tried, he still connected with Grocery Girl. Now you see that is destiny. Yeah, but it could also be just dumb luck. Maybe they meet up... and then they find out there is no connection. Possibly. I guess. - Could be. - You see what I mean now? Oh. I really believe that the kind of connection Norman and I share is different. Like, even though we just met, it's like, I dunno... It feels like we've known each other for so long. And even when we spend the whole day together, it's never enough. I just feel like, he's got to be feeling the same way too. I can't be the only one. [Auntie] Oh, Mae. [whimsical music] [camera shutter clicks] ONE WORD SHIRTS IS A SUCCESS! A LOT OF ORDERS CAME IN FROM THE WEBSITE. ALL THANKS TO YOU, NORMAN! [music continues] HOPEFUL [chuckles] SEEN WED 6:14 PM [Mark] Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Hey, don't... Don't take it out on the T-shirts. It's not their fault. Look, I'm not taking it out on the shirts, all right? And it's very obvious. It's perfectly clear... he's not replying 'cause he's in the shower. Or he's with someone else. [phone ringing and vibrating] [phone key beeps] Hello? Norman? [Norman] Sorry, Mae. I couldn't get to the phone. I was busy with the preparations. My youngest sister is getting married soon. But I saw the photos of your orders. You know, we should celebrate. Sure! What did I tell you? Where should we go? You know, we could do it here. I owe you at least a good dinner. What would you like to eat? Mae, you can't cook. Oh, uh, thanks, Mae. But I can't tonight. I'm meeting with Grocery Girl. [chuckles] I'm actually on my way there. Wish me luck. [laughs] Good luck! [laughing] But you should really be careful, Norman. There are just so many scams going on out there, you know. I think it's best you don't go. [Norman chuckles] Don't worry. I'm sure she's totally cool. Oh. So where are you guys meeting? At some local bar. Uh, Cheers and Beers? [Mark whispers] Cheers and Tears. Hello, Mae? Mae, are you still there? Mae. Hello, Norman. You keep cutting in and out. Uh, hello? Norman? [imitates static sound] [grunts] [screams] [grunts] [Mark snickers] [imitates static sound] [laughing] [Mark] What was that you said? "Perfectly clear!" [Mark laughing] [upbeat music playing] [romantic music] [romantic music rises] [music fades] Green hoodie. White shirt. [chuckles] Julia. Uh, Norman. Norman. Norman! [romantic music] [both laugh] [dramatic music] [crying] [Mae] Let's see here. LOOKING FOR GROCERY GIRL Dammit, "JGirl." "Julia Diaz." Influencer? Salon Owner? So you think you're all that, huh? Just 'cause you have all those followers, whoop-dee-doo. [laughs] Wow. You're really hurting. Are you any of that? Pretty? Popular? Could you be a movie star? Just give me a free ticket. It ain't worth the money. But I met him first. We were doing fine. We were in love, then she shows up and just swoops him up. Hang on, wasn't she there first? You're the one who jumped the line. Besides, you're overreacting. Why, has Norman posted anything about you? Mark, what is it she has that I don't? Oh, right. Owns a salon. A vlogger. A mid-level influencer. Perfect hair, perfect body, perfect life. Actually, the question should be, "What do you have that she doesn't?" Hm... You have a cat, yes. And... Influence? On yourself, yes. A business that, uh... is beginning to pick up a little bit, yeah. Uh... Hm, body? Okay. Smile? Yeah. Mm... Oh, I know something you have that she doesn't... Split ends. [Mark gasps] Oh, my God! You're such a jerk! You're not exactly a supermodel yourself, all right? What? You mean this face? You used to like it well enough. Anyway, you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? Your hair looks like straw. - Fine. - Hm? Goodbye, split ends. [laughing] [upbeat music] [distant chattering] CAN YOU DO IT, GIRL? Um... Excuse me, a haircut, please. Can I get your senior stylist, please? - [staff] Oh, you mean Ms. Julia? - Yeah. Wow. Actually, we're fully booked. And you need to call five days ahead to make an appointment. Plus, she doesn't take walk-ins, she's so busy. Sorry. [dramatic music] [Julia] Abby, no, it's okay. I got this. My next appointment is not until three. I think I can squeeze her in. - [Abby] Are you sure? Really? - Mm-hm. Of course. Hi! What's your name? Hi. Mae. Hi, I'm Julia. All right, shall we? - [Julia] Hello? Ready? - Huh? - Let's go. - Uh, yeah. It's okay. Don't be nervous. - [Julia] Let's go. - [chuckles] Hey, sis. You okay? Hm? [chuckles] I follow you on social media. Aw, you're one of my followers? Thank you! - [giggles] - [chuckles] I bet it feels good to be an influencer. You have so many followers. Like 35,000. [chuckles] What's it like to have so many guys after you? Oh, if only. But that's not true. I don't believe you. You're so beautiful. Yeah, that's... Well, apparently, I'm too sexy. [Julia giggles] Just kidding. [chuckles] [whispers] So full of herself. - Excuse me. Huh? - Huh? I mean, if I had a beautiful face and a body like yours, why wouldn't I flaunt it, right? That's true in a way. But the thing is, most men will tell you there are women to be taken seriously and others to be taken for a ride. In my case, no one takes me seriously. But, you know what? I met someone not too long ago. Just sharing. Can't help it. [chuckles] Been together long? A few weeks now. Ah... So you guys are totally dating, then? [Julia] Mm-hm. What about you? Anyone make your heart go pitter-pat? Actually... I have to say, a lot of people find me intimidating. It's not like I can do anything about it, it's what happens when you're pretty and successful, right? [chuckles] I know, sis! I feel you! - Soul sisters! - [chuckles] - Just kidding. - Huh? But there is someone. But he likes another woman. Oh, come on, sis. You must keep fighting for him, and as long as there isn't a ring on it, well, there's no harm in trying, right? - You're absolutely right. - Of course. That's why I'll make you look so pretty. He won't be able to look away and he'll toss that other girl out of the way. [Mae chuckles] That girl better be... ready for a fight. Ooh! And show attitude. All right. Raise your eyebrows. [Julia] That's it. Raise a bit. Not too high. Lower them a bit. There. Way to go, girl. Work those eyes. Your brush must float in your hand when you apply the powder on your lids following the shape of your eye. It's important to respect - your eye's natural contour. - This is hard. Oh... Looks like a black eye. It's important to keep blending. [Julia] Just keep blending, sis. Don't give up. Oh, sis! Oh, jeez. Wow! Love it! HI, NORMAN! YOU FREE LATER? Please answer your phone. Ring, please. [phone chimes] ITEMS PURCHASED: 1 X HOPEFULLY XL, 1 X YOU M [sighs] No, not that. Text back, please. [sighs] Come on, Norman. Look at your phone. - Please. - [phone chimes] HOW ABOUT NOW? ARE YOU FREE? [chuckles] [phone key clacking] "Sure, sure." SURE? WHERE DO WE MEET? [chuckles] [phone chimes] On my way. [squeals] [boy 1] Recall. - Can you counter that? - Casting Supreme Leader. [boy 2] What's he putting down? Norman! Hi! [indistinct chatter] [Mae chuckles] - Hi. - [Norman chuckles] Why are you all dressed up? - Why? This is just my usual... - Julia? GODDESS [boy 1] Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, sorry. I thought you were Julia. - [boy 1] My bad. - Sit down. Come and join us. I just put that down... - Hey, guys! - This is Jeric. This is Jamie, and Toni. - Hi! Hello! - Hello! Office pals. - This is Mae, my friend. - Hm. [Jamie] All right, my turn. Casting... Elven Friendship card. [Jeric exclaims] See them counter that, bro. Come on, Norman. Your turn. What's this game? Can I play too? - Hang on, uh... I gotta think here. - [Jamie] Nothing to think about, bro. Let's see what he comes up with. - [Norman] How's that? - [Jamie] Oh, my God! - [laughs] - Nice! Now, that's The Spark of Romance card. Ten damage points for you, Jamie. [Jamie] And you got me. What now? There's spark... It trumps friendship. [Jamie] Right. As if. Well, hold on a second. Personally, I'd always choose friendship over spark, 'cause a spark doesn't last. It eventually fizzles right out and dies. Unless, you keep fanning the flames and, uh... keep things nice and hot, right, bro? - Amen to that! - [Jamie] Right on, bro. - [laughter] - I wasn't even talking to you. No? Come on. [chuckles] Well, the damage from Spark is ten points. And the damage from friendship is five points. But a friendship is a lot more important than a relationship. 'Cause a friendship is based on compatibility and like, the kind of values you share, it's much more sincere. The connection is much stronger. [Mae chuckles] Hang on. What are we talking about here? Okay, but just a sec... Personally, I prefer instant attraction. You meet... and then, boom! - [Jeric] Like a ton of bricks. - [Jamie] Whoa, bro! - Instant goosebumps, and like fireworks. - Come on. It's like there's a force, you know, kind of a push and a pull... [chuckles] There's that tension, you see? And that's exciting. [laughs] [Jeric] Right? And then you really feel the spark. What a jerk. Keeps butting in. Anyway, who came up with that spark idea, huh? It's just like New Year's Eve. [romantic music] There's fireworks. [Norman chuckles] They disappear, but then, you always know they'll light up the sky again. [Norman] It's always new, always exciting. [Jamie] You hear that? Holy cow! Look at the smile on his face! He just can't wipe it off, right? [laughter] Why would I do that? Do they sell sparks, here? I'm a buyer. Wrap 'em up, I'll take them all. [laughter] Now, check this out. [dramatic music] [phone keys clacking] Ten more minutes. - Huh? - Ten minutes. [sighs] I'm really sorry. If only I had a car, well, I'd drive you there. No, it's fine. It's not like I'm your girlfriend or anything. [Norman chuckles] It doesn't matter. You're my friend, aren't you? It's important for me to know that my friends get home safe. - [chuckles] - [phone keys clacking] - So where's Julia? - Ah! You didn't bring her along. Is there a reason? She's getting ready for an event. I see. - How are you guys doing? - You know what... We're doing great. Everything feels so easy with her. I'm relaxed. I feel like I can handle anything. [both chuckling] It's like you're saying that I'm difficult to be with. Like you feel awkward around me. Of course, it's not the same. When I'm with you, I feel so comfortable. You're like family, you know. [dramatic music] [phone keys clacking] [Norman chuckles] I really thought things would get awkward after we... Hey! [chuckles] Sorry! [Mae] It's okay. It's not that big of a deal. Anyway, it's all in the past. Yeah, for sure. You're something else. And so, Julia? When am I gonna get to meet her? You've got to introduce us. You know, this weekend she's got this event. Do you want to come along? You mean this weekend coming up? [chuckles] Yes, of course. Sure. Yes! You'll get to spend some time with Jeric. Hm? Didn't you notice? He was trying to impress you earlier? He was? Mm, no. I didn't notice. No. It'll be great. When we get to the event, I'm sure you'll notice Jeric. [Mae chuckles] FIGHT [dramatic music] HOPEFUL [Mae] Oh, shit. Shit! [grunts] Oh, man... [grunts] [grunting] [breathes heavily] I can't stand this. [exhales sharply] Can't be... [sniffles] [dance music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Mae] Norman! [giggles] [Norman chuckles] - Norman, hey! - [Mae chuckles] Oh, my gosh. I think I know you. You're one of my clients, aren't you? Mm, mm-hm. - Wait, you two know each other? - Yes, I worked my magic on her. You like the makeover? Now I get it. [Mae chuckles] So, she's the Mae you've been talking about, right? What? You've been talking about me? [Julia] Oh, yes. He told me about you and Jeric. [Julia squeals] [dance music playing] Mm. Speaking of. - Hi! - [Jeric] Hi, Mae! Hello. Hi. [chuckles] Wow, wow! I really like your hat. You look like an artist. I'm not talking to you. [chuckles awkwardly] Uh, Julia... by the way, what is this event about exactly? It's the official launch of Ventíse Hair Treatment and they got us as partners. And guess what? They chose me as their brand influencer! [Julia] Oh, my gosh! I wonder why? Just kidding. [laughs] Kidding. [laughter] Oh, Julia, we're ready for you. - Sorry, I'll see you later. - Go on. Go! - [Mae] Norman... - [Julia] Oh, Norman, come with me. - Please? Let's go. - [Norman] Huh? So, Mae, uh, have you eaten yet? - [Jeric] You hungry? - Just shut up. - Okay. - Get me some water. - Huh? - Move it, I'm getting pissed. Wa-water. Yeah. With ice? - Hurry up. - Okay. [Jeric] Excuse me, sir! FIGHT [dance music] That's my favorite from the product range. Come on, try it. Okay. [chuckles] [dance music playing] Is he the one you were telling me about who likes somebody else? Huh? Who do you mean? I'm talking about Jeric. You remember? Good memory. I'd totally forgotten about it. Ah... Julia. I'm not sure how to say this. But I find that when Norman's with me, he's much happier. [Mae] Much calmer. In this environment, he looks out of place. He's changed since he's been dating you. He's not the same person. I barely recognize him. - You think so? - Mm-hm. I bring out the best in him, right? You can't always play it safe. In order for you to grow, you have to get out of your comfort zone, right? I find Norman has more energy when he is with me. If you prod him a little bit, you get to see what he's truly capable of. [Mae coughs] All he needs is a partner who knows how to challenge him. Ow. - Oh, sorry. Got stuck. - But wouldn't you say... that if you really love someone, you have to accept them as they are? No. You shouldn't drag him into your world, Julia. Why, with your looks... you can get any man you want, Julia. Why settle on Norman? It did cross my mind, but... Mae, I just know he's the one. There's no one better for me. No one who comes even close. [Julia] Norman is a good man. He'll take care of me and ask for nothing. He looks awkward. He just doesn't like to draw attention. He's also very sincere. I know he'll never cheat on me. He's totally the reason I want to be a better person. For him, my past, whatever I went through... doesn't matter. All he cares about is who I am today. But why do you say that? Who was yesterday's Julia? [chuckles] Haven't we all done things in the past that we now sorely regret? [Mae chuckles] [both chuckle] [Norman] Okay. [upbeat music playing in distance] [both] Getting some air. [Norman chuckles] [both] It's getting crowded in there. [both chuckle] I can't keep up. So much nervous energy. It's on another level. Yeah, I hear you. [both] It's impossible to keep up with that crowd. [both laugh] Don't need to pretend. Obviously, you fit in just fine. Not really. There's something missing. [Norman sighs] I'm glad I found you out here. I needed a break. Shall we... head back in? [Norman exhales] Oh, wait, Julia's looking for me. - [Norman] I better go. - [chuckles] - [Norman] Come on. - Right behind you! [dance music] [dance music playing] [indistinct background chatter] [Jeric exclaims] [muttering] [exhales] [dance music] [dance music playing] - [Jeric muttering] - [crowd cheering] [woman 1] Oh my God, look at her. She really did change! I mean, she finally got someone to love her. [man] Well, after all the stuff she did, wouldn't you want to change? She was pretty wild. [woman 1] Well, at least she changed for the better. [woman 2] Would you cut it out? Give her a chance, guys. [woman 1] Okay. They look good together, don't they? So sweet. No, they don't! Fuck this. [groans] [solemn music] [Mae] "With my love." Who you stole from me. And those lips... Yeah, right! As if! Totally fake. So much surgery. Totally plastic. Nothing's real. [Mark] One more heartbreak. Team Love loses. [solemn music] That's it, keep drinking. Feels like an extreme case of dejà vu, right? Please, just buzz off. [Mae] You're nothing but a liar. I never lied to you. I just didn't tell you the truth. And I should be grateful for that? [scoffs] Mark, is this what I deserve? Not to be told the truth? [scoffs] Oh, come on, Mark. You should've let me know that you were unhappy. I did tell you. But you never listen to me. You only hear yourself. If I didn't hear you, maybe you should've spoken louder. Mae. Why did I resign? How the heck should I know? You see this scar? Where did you get that? See? You so want people to understand you, yet you don't reciprocate. [chuckles] Wow, really, Mark? All I wanted was to love you. And for you to love me back. But you didn't love me the way I needed to be loved. You were smothering me, you never gave me any room to breathe. Mark, you're the one who left. You left me. Even though I never did anything to you. That's just it! You didn't do anything. [solemn music] [sighs deeply] [chuckles] Is this what you really want? Fine. What are you hiding? [playful music] INFLUENCER JULIA DIAZ CHEATED ON HER EX! [vlogger] Julia Diaz is being talked about again on social media because of a cheating scandal. Sis, is this who you were? THE NEVER-ENDING CHEATING ISSUE DRUNK? JULIA DIAZ PARTIED AGAIN [Mae] Sis! You really shouldn't have done that. Who are these people? Sis... [laughter and cheers on video] Geesh... Norman needs to know about this. [clicks] [clears throat] [keyboard clacking] [clicks] You thought you were smart? NEVER SATISFIED! SO WRONG! HOW COULD YOU? "You're too much, girl." There. [playful music] Norman, she's not for you. Didn't I have you first for crying out loud? A WHOLE NEW LEVEL! Norman... I'm the right woman for you. She's not for you because I'm the one. I'm the one who deserves you. I'm the best girlfriend ever. [sniffling] Mm, you deserve me. [clicks] [laptop chiming] [chiming continues] [loud clanging] - Ha! It's a celebration! - Huh? What the... - Celebration it is! Whoop! - [Mae groaning] Hey! Victory! How does it feel to be a champion? - [Mark] What's up? Are you happy? - [groaning] Through victory or abject failure, I will always stand by you. [exclaiming] [loud clanging] [Mae] Will you stop that? It's too early to be so noisy! What's the matter? I'm just celebrating. I can't believe it! You are so sneaky! You know, you should write for the tabloids. I'm telling you. The online gossips are having a field day! You don't know? Check your Facebook. It's buzzing. I don't know how you slept through all the notifications. - Huh? - Hm. [laptop chiming] [groans] YUCK, SHE'S CHEATING ON HER BOYFRIEND SHOCKING! SUCH CHEAP TASTE IN GUYS. WHO'S THIS? WHAT A FAMEWHORE SO MANY CHEATERS, BOYS AND GIRLS RIGHT? SHE LOOKS INNOCENT AND SWEET. STARLETS ARE TROUBLE WHAT A SLUT! WHAT? NASTY! SUCH A FLIRT! What the fuck? [laughs] Harlot! That's hilarious! [Mark laughing] I'm impressed by the choice of words! Floozy? UNFOLLOWED! YOU'RE THE WORST, GIRL! - [exclaiming] - [clanging] Yes! Let's all cancel Julia! High-five! Come on, it's a victory... Oh... [laughs] [Julia] All the... All the videos... and all the photos you saw online, it's all real. YOUR MAKEUP'S GONE! KEEP CRYING! DM ME, I'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY BRO, STOP THE DRAMA But it's not what you're all thinking. It was just a friend's birthday party. And nothing more. I just really hope you don't judge me based on that. [Julia sobbing] And to anyone that I may have hurt, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [phone keys clacking] She deactivated all of her accounts. She even deleted all of her YouTube videos. I'd tone it down if I were you. It's obviously getting the better of you. No, Auntie. You don't understand. I'm doing this for Norman. I'm doing him a favor, all right? I'm just showing him the kind of woman he's supposedly in love with. Mae, do you remember the pain you felt when Jenny came into the picture and split you and Mark up? What does that have to do with this? [Auntie] You're being Jenny now. That's exactly what you're doing to Julia and Norman. Don't you see? That's exactly what you're doing. You are Jenny! Not true! I'm not like Jenny! I'm just fighting for the best thing that's ever happened to me in my whole... Another thing. Why does it always have to be that the best thing in your life has to be a man? First, it was Mark and now it's Norman. Why does your happiness have to revolve around a man all the time? And then what? No way am I ending up an old maid like you. - Absolutely not! - Oh, wow! You're being insulting, you realize that? [groans] This is my choice. If you love me, you should side with me. And now you're insinuating that I don't love you. I've seen you at your absolute worst and I'm still here. Your parents have passed away, yet I'm still here. - I never left you... - Auntie, it's not enough! I want more! I need more! And if I can't be enough for myself, then how can you? Think about it. [solemn music] Norman. POWER Sorry I'm late. I had a few orders I needed to get ready to go. Why didn't I see through it earlier? See through what earlier? I broke up with Julia. Sorry it didn't work out. She wasn't the woman I thought she was. [sniffles] I was the last person in the whole entire country to know about it. She told me that... [sniffles, exhales] ...all those men in the photos and videos are just her friends. I don't buy it. [sighs] Turns out, I'm just an orbiter. of the many pulled into... her gravity. [Norman scoffs] Was I wrong? Hm? Maybe I shouldn't have trusted her. - Maybe I should've listened to... - No, no. Um... You made the right choice. I don't know, Was she just playing with me? The one time I trust someone. The one time I give my heart. This happens. [Norman sighs] She's so beautiful. Way too beautiful for me. She could never love me. You know, sometimes, you, uh... you think you know... you think you know someone and then something happens... and then they end up disappointing you? Right? Nobody's honest anymore. Don't say that. I really think you should let her go. Besides, I'm here for you. [whimsical music] [Norman] You know what? She's supposed to be my plus one... at my sister's, uh, rehearsal dinner... for the wedding. Oh, I can't. [sighs] You weigh a ton. [Norman sighs] I can just hear my mom saying... [in high-pitched voice] "Is this what you really want? Grow old alone? You want that?" [laughs] Hey! [in normal voice] They have no idea... how hard it is these days to find a girlfriend. [Mae chuckles] All right, I can carry you now. [Mae grunts] I feel like I keep disappointing them. What do I do? I can be your plus one, you know. Yeah, really? I just have to... take care of a few details but, uh... Fine, I'll be there. I can't stand to see you sad so I'll go with you. You are the best. You're so good to me. Good thing you're cute. - I heard that, you know. - You're just drunk. - I heard what you said. What was it? - No. I dunno what you're talking about. What did you just... I heard that. You said something. [whimsical music] Christmas party on your agenda? Dressing up as a candy cane? There's a mascot from a fast food chain who looks just like that. [Mae grunts] So, how's business going? Or is it on hold? You decide to start a business, but you won't keep it going. That's not what matters right now, because I need to make a good impression. Norman is going to introduce me to his family today. Because we're deeply in love, Mark. What was that? Uh, say it again. I thought I heard something about you guys being, um... Deeply in love. - Amazing. Deeply in love already. - Mm-hm. - Of course. Why not? - [Mark scoffs] I'm totally in love. All he did was ask you to be his plus one and you're already in love with the guy. Hm-hm. Okay. What I wanna know is what exactly made you fall in love with him? Right, it's the eyes. Yes, he's got beautiful eyes. Yes. Indeed, he does. Ah, his nose. Of course. - Nicely shaped. A bit sharp, but yeah. - His nose is nicely shaped. Yeah, yeah. I get it. Okay, what else? Hair. I recognize the style. It's, uh... - He's got great hair, right? - It's uh... Yeah, very trendy. Oh, that's it! He's invited you 'cause he wants to introduce you to his folks. - Hm? - And then, he'll go down on one knee - and pull out a ring! - [exclaims] And soon, you'll be standing right there at the altar! Oh, God! - [giggling] - You're such a dreamer! [laughing] You're really good at ruining things for me. But not tonight. Come on, get in. - Get in there! - No wait, I'm coming with you. - No, you're not! Now, get in. - Hey, wait! Ouch! - [Mark] Mae! - [shushing] - Mae, you need me there! - No, I don't need you. - [Mark] What about your reality check? - Oh, not from you. You're useless to me. [Mark] No. No, I'm not. You can't do this without me. [Mae shushing] [sighs] [cheerful music] [humming] Hello, Auntie. Hm, okay. [chuckles] Pleased to meet you, Mom. [whimsical music] - There... - All right. [indistinct background chatter] - Here's good? - Thank you. - Norman! - Mae! Hello! Am I too early? Uh, no. Actually, you're right on time. All the guests are here. Badge wanted it to be intimate so... Oh, you must be Norman's girlfriend? Oh, my! Hi! Are you my brother's girlfriend? Badge, this is Mae. Mae is a friend. Oh. Nice to meet you all. [romantic music playing] [indistinct chatter] I'm sorry. Were you caught off guard? It's okay. Congratulations to your sister. [sighs] They haven't really seen me with anyone, you know. Actually, this is the first time. So I'm the... first girl you brought here? What do you think? Do they like me? Do I pass the test? Mae. You really don't have to worry about that because there is no test to pass. I'm just happy you're here as my friend, you know. - That's all. - [chuckles awkwardly] Sure. Friends. Nothing more. - Mae, is there a problem? - Oh, no. None whatsoever. We're really good. We are really, really, really, really, really perfectly good. - [chuckles] - Is everything okay? I mean... We are friends, aren't we? I'm not sure I understand. Is it something I said? Well, to be perfectly honest with you... [dramatic music] What if, uh... What if I want to be more than just your friend? [woman] Who's that? Julia? What are you doing here? You bitch. Julia, wait up! Norman! [Norman] Julia, don't go! [Norman's mom sighs] Uh, I just... Just let them be. Please eat. Julia, wait, please. Please, let's talk about this. Don't go. I just asked her to come along, that's all. Please. Norman. - Is everything okay? - I knew it. I could just tell... she had her sight set on you. I thought you were at the salon. I saw all the things... You saw what? You saw the filth that's being said about me? Yeah, I saw that. Someone's out to ruin my reputation. Am I right to think so, Mae? I'm being constantly bullied. I can't even leave my own house. [Julia] Then I thought of you, Norman. That you'd be lonely. So I came over, at the risk of being criticized by your family. Because I love you. But here I am, and who do I see with you? The only person who'd benefit directly from seeing me lose it all. Why am I not surprised? Come on, if I were still around, he'd never look at you! She must've had too much to drink, she's not making sense, Norman. Julia, drop it, please. I have no idea what you're talking about. This is awkward. Is she why you broke up with me? [Norman] No. Mae has nothing to do with it. This is about us! You were acting like he's yours, but you stole him from me! You made him believe your bullshit! Calm down, please. That is not true. I know you're the one behind The Real Julia online page! [Julia] My life was just fine before you showed up! You're like a rabid dog online, but look at you now! You've got no bite! I really have no clue what you're talking about or what you're referring to. You're just a jealous little wannabe! Why can't you just admit you're in love with him and can't stand the fact that I'm the one he loves? That's not true. [Julia] Why don't you stop lying to yourself? The fact is, you're not the one he wants, he wants me! That is not true! You're lying! It's not... It's not true! I'm the one... What did you do? I should be the one for you. I just wanted you to see what kind of woman she really is! To protect you! A woman should always trust her instincts, right? Okay, look. Between the two of us, you're the prettier one. [Mae] You're also sexier. But so what? You're just a pretty face who has no idea of what's really going on 'cause deep down, you're just a slut. You're calling me a slut? You have no right to call me that! You came here just to make a scene, didn't you? Norman, make her leave now. Norman, she's the one making a scene. She should go. [Norman sighs] Julia, please. [Norman] You should go home. Come on, now. Let's go. I'll take you, all right? Mae? What did I ever do to deserve the way you've been treating me? It's not my fault the man you love loves me and not you! And you! [Julia] Is this the kind of love you want? A woman ready to ruin the lives of others and stop at nothing to get what she wants. [Julia sobs] Julia. Please. Please, please. [Julia sobbing] [sniffles] Julia. Norman. Norman, are you okay? [solemn music] What was it you said before? "Sometimes, you think you know someone, then they disappoint you." No one's honest anymore. But Norman, she doesn't deserve someone like you. Who deserves me then? You? Norman, we're totally compatible. We're both happy when we are together. You love me, I love you. We're totally in love with each other, aren't we? [Mae grunts] I don't love you. [solemn music] [sobs] And I've never pretended I did, have I? Not once have I given you reason to believe I had feelings for you other than as a friend. [sobbing softly] You never listened. I was always clear you are only a friend. You are not the missed connection I was trying to find. [Mae] Norman. Choose me, please. Please. I'll do anything for you. [Mae] I'll open a beauty salon. I'll become an influencer. Norman, I'll do whatever it takes for you to love me, please. Please. - Please. - [Norman grunts] [Mae] Please. [sobbing] You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me! [sobbing] If this is how you love, then it's very scary. [sobbing continues] I really thought I knew you. I was wrong. Now, listen... you better delete all the stuff you posted. Please. [sobbing] And I don't ever want to see you again. [sobbing] [Mae] Norman, I'm sorry. Please. Please, I'm sorry. [solemn music] [sobbing] Sorry. [solemn music] [grunts] [breathes heavily] [cat meows] Fe? Fe? Hello, come to Mama. [Mae] Come on. Come on, come here. [Fe meowing] Come on, Fe. Come to Mama. Come to Mama, come on. Please? Fe! Come. Right now! Listen, I said come to Mama! Fe! Come to Mama! Come to Mama. [sobbing] Everything... everything is all ruined. Everything... [sobbing] [solemn music] - [Mae sobbing] - [thumping] I can't take this. I'm so fed up. [sobbing] Mae, what happened to you? MESSY [grunts] [sobbing continues] [solemn music] [mouse clicks] [phone key clicks] [clacking] I DELETED THE PAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY BUT... I'M SORRY. [dramatic music] HEAD OVER HEELS Why is it... no matter what I do, it's never enough. Yeah, I totally get you. Sometimes, it's really hard to accept the truth. Too much love can really be... suffocating. Loving too much is not a crime, you know. No, it's not a crime. But, Mae... have you ever asked yourself why I'm still hanging around? I'm still here because... you're unable to let go of me. You'd much rather live with your pain, than... embrace being on your own. Aren't you the one who once said that you and I were soulmates? Who was the first one to leave, huh? The first one to give up? You were. Mae. Look around you. You're still holding on to all my stuff. Plus, all the stuff from your parents. It's kinda jam-packed in here. Do you think a part of us exist in those things? Do you think you can bring us back? Whatever, Mark. Just leave me alone. Have you ever asked yourself why I'm still here? Why you won't get rid of me? [solemn music] You're holding on to remnants of the past 'cause that's all you have left. And you are desperately clinging to your memories even when there's this beautiful world out there for you to experience. I'm not saying you should forget about me. Or your family, no. The problem is... All you ever want is to be with us. Even though we merely exist in your head. [Mark] You're so afraid of being alone. You're hungry for sympathy. And who's going to give it to you? We are? Are you seeing yourself right now? You're practically begging for love. Is that what you want? You're like a... a newborn. [imitates baby crying] "Don't wanna!" "Oh, baby, shh, shh..." [imitates baby crying] "Okay, there, there. It's okay." "I don't wanna..." [imitates baby breathing] You're exhausting. [Mark] There's nothing left of us. And even though we gave you everything, it'll never be enough 'cause you never learned to love and respect yourself. You can't stand on your own two feet and fend for yourself because you know what you are? A coward! I'm not a coward. - You are too! Coward! - I'm not... I'm sick of this. Aw... come on, Mae, you can't live without me. [Mark] That's the way you like it. I'm sick and tired of this, okay? [solemn music] Uh, Mae? [Mark] Mae! Mae. Where are you going, huh? What are you doing? What are you up to? Are you cleaning up? You're tidying things up! [Mark snickers] Here we go again. You start something but you never finish anything. You realize this is a huge pile of trash! Kinda like your life, really. This'll take a while, Mae. Come on, tell me. Why are you doing this? Why are you cleaning? 'Cause I'm sick and tired. I'm done with you! [Mark] Mae, wait. Hang on a second. Mae! Hold on a minute! Mae! Mae! But you need me in your life! No, I don't. - Mae, you're still in love. - No, I'm not. Mae, please, please, please! Don't do this! But you still love me. I know it, you need me! Please, Mae! - Get in there. I don't need you. - Don't do this to me. Stop, please! - [Mark] No! Mae! Mae! Mae! - [grunting] Mae! [grunts] - [panting] - [Mark] Mae! So Mae, you think you're strong enough, huh? You can't do it! You're pathetic! I can damn well do it if I want to, Mark. Mae... Hey, wait! Mae! What are you doing? Please! Please, Mae! Mae, please! Come on! Don't do this. Don't do this, please. No, come on! Don't do it! [Mark] Mae, please! Mae, don't! Wait, no. Mae. Mae! Mae! [Mark groaning] Mae! [groaning continues] [breathing heavily] [dramatic music] Hi, baby. YOU [music fades] You want a hand, Auntie? SENTIMENTAL So, are you here to help me out or invite me to your wedding? Yeah, right. As if that'll happen. Auntie, what if I told you... that you were right and I was an idiot? Would you forgive me for what I said before? Mae. You're not an idiot. You just weren't the right one for him. [solemn music] [Mae exhales] I just can't believe it. I was so hurt. It was so painful. It felt like he's been stolen from me. Like this big betrayal. But the truth is, I was the one... I was the villain of the story. I just followed my heart. Auntie, does that really make me a bad person? Before he came into my life, I always felt like... I was missing something. I had no one. My life was empty. Then he came along and everything changed. Before, I couldn't do anything. I kept thinking I can't be alone. I should be with someone, have someone to do things with. I couldn't admit to myself that it was simply because... I hated being alone. Couldn't handle it. [thuds] [grunts] - You are enough. - Ow, Auntie. Don't ever forget that. When all is said and done, the only person you can truly count on is you! [Auntie] Hm? And what about you? Are you happy living without prince charming? Yes, I am. But how can you? Got used to it. [dramatic music] [chuckles] Used to it, huh? That's not encouraging. That's what's called strength. [mutters] It's the power of being at peace. [upbeat music] [Auntie] Peace. - Auntie... you want one? - What? - Thanks, Mae. - Have a bite. [Auntie giggles] [cheerful music] The barbecue cut. - [Mae] Just a pound. Yes. - [staff] In half? Thank you! [clattering] Uh, sorry. - Mark. - Mae. How are you? Uh... I'm all right. This is awkward. [chuckles] What are you doing here? I'm here to pray. Joking. Groceries. [laughs] You're buying food for you and Jenny? Looks like you'll be cooking. You can't cook to save your soul. [both chuckle] Maybe not, but I can still cook better than you. Okay, fine. I won't argue with you. [both laugh] Congrats, by the way. Your T-shirt business. [Mark] I saw it online. You're all over social media. Good job. [Mae] Really? Thank you. I'm glad that... Well, I'm glad that you and Jenny are doing well. [dramatic music] Mae. I never got to apologize. I've kinda been avoiding you, all this time. Now I'm starting a family, and I don't want any loose ends. I'm sorry I cheated on you. You didn't deserve that, and I don't have an excuse. Don't worry about it. It's forgotten already. [chuckles] Kidding. And I forgive you. It means a lot to me to hear you say that, really. Thank you. [chuckles] You take care. - You too! - Sure.
