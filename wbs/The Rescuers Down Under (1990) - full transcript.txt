Thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area... and some of the surrounding gullies. Cody! - Yeah, Mom? - What about your breakfast? - I've got some sandwiches in my pack. - Be home for supper. No worries, Mom. I know! I'm coming. Hustle up, Nelson. Faloo is sounding the call! Come on, little wombats! Hurry! - Who's caught this time? - You don't know her, Cody. Her name is Marahute, the great golden eagle. Where is she? She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap. - You're the only one who can reach her. - I'll get her loose. Righto! Hop on! No time to lose. She's up on top of that ridge. Be careful, little friend. Marahute! Calm down, calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you. That's a girl. Stay still. It's okay. Whoa! Wait! I'm gonna help you! Easy, easy! You're free! No! Higher! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! You're a mom! They're very warm. Are they gonna hatch soon? Where's the daddy eagle? Oh. My dad's gone too. - Hey, little fella, what happened to you? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no! - Get away! Get away! It's a trap! It's a trap! Be careful! No! - Don't worry, I'll get you loose. Whoa! Got one! - Are you all right? - Yeah, I think so. - Okey-dokey! - Wait! Hey, come back! Here you go. Grab on. That's great! Just a little more, a little further. There, I got it! Uh-oh! Yikes! Well, Joanna, what'd we get today? A dingo, a fat old razorback... or a nice big... boy? Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again? Dumb lizard's always tryin' to bury squirrels out here. Uh-uh, it's a trap, and poachin's against the law. Trap? Where'd you get an idea like that, boy? I thinkyou've been down in that hole for too long. Well, come on, grab a hold. We'll get you out of this little old lizard hole, and you can just run along home. This is a poacher's trap, and you're a poacher! Let go! Hey, get off of me! I'm gonna kill her. I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy... egg-suckin' salamander! Cut it out! Get off! Good girl,Joanna. Say, where'd you get this pretty feather, boy? It was a present. Oh, that's real nice. Who gave it to you? It's a secret. That's no secret, boy. You see, I already got the father. Now you just tell me where Mama and those little eggs are. - No! - Joanna, sic him! You're comin' with me, boy. My mom will call the Rangers! Oh, no! Not the Rangers! What'll I do? What'll I do? Don't let your ma call the Rangers, please! My poor baby boy got eaten by the crocodiles! Boo-hoo-hoo! Let's go, boy. Help! Help! Help, help, help! Send for help! McLeach took a boy!

To my dear Bernard... and our wonderful partnership. Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, wond-- wonderful. You've been very quiet this evening. Is there something on your mind?

Not now, Francois! I'm busy! No, no, no, no, monsieur! You don't-- - Bernard, did you talk to Francois? - Ah, yes, but, uh, there's some-- There's something I want-- I know exactly what you're going to say. Francois told me all about it. - He did? H-H-How did he know? - Oh, it doesn't matter. I think it's a marvellous idea. You do? I mean, you-- You really want to? I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty. Du-Duty? I-I never thought of it-- Well, um, all ri-- All right. H-How does-- How does next, uh-- next April sound to you? Heavens no! We must act immediately, tonight! Tonight? But-But, uh, wait! Uh, Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't you at least need a-a gown or something? No. Just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots. Hiking boots? Ah, there you are! Now come along, come along, come along. Delegates, we have an important announcement. Bernard and I have decided... to accept the mission to Australia. - Australia? - Oh, good show! Now, you must fly out immediately! It's a little nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we? What? Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's such a good idea to-to fly this soon after eating! Darling, you'll be just fine. B-But aren't-aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes? Oh, just knock on the door and-and see if Orville is there. Well, n-nobody's home. Let's go. Bernard, this is no time to play in the snow! I wasn't playing in the snow. It-It was an avalanche. Oh, look, Bernard! "Under new management. See Wilbur." Come on, darling. Let's get a move out. When I put 'em on I'm a-rarin' to go Man, you oughta see me with a derby on I know that you would say he's gone Black slacks Mostly in the head, black slacks Well, that's what I say Black slacks I'm the cat's pyjamas Always runnin' around with crazy little mamas Yoo-hoo, Mr Wilbur. - Get down there, son! - Hello! Pick it, boy! Pick it! Yeah! Here we go! Let's walk! Look out! Excuse me-- Bernard, do something. He can't hear us. Big time! Big time! Well, the girls all look when I go by 'Cause wh-- - Hey, who killed the music? - That's better. Excuse us for interrupting. We are from the Rescue Aid Society. - I am Miss Bianca and this is my-- - Miss Bianca? The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it. My brother Orville told me all about you. Oh, boy! This is an honour to have-- May I just say "Enchant?, senorita" to you? May I? - We need to charter a flight. - Well, you've come to the right place, buddy boy. Welcome to Albatross Air. "A Fair Fare From Here To There." You get it? "A fair fare." It's-It's a play on-- Never mind. I've got tons of exotic destinations, faraway places... custom designed for "a romantic weekend getaway"... as well as the finest in-flight accommodations. Speaking of which, what can I get you? How about a nice Mango Maui Cooler? Very, very nice. Very tasty. - No, thankyou. - Or a, uh-- Oh, the Coconut Guava Nectar. It's carbonated, very nice. I got little umbrellas for each one of them, in a little coconut thing. No! It's urgent that we leave immediately! - Nothing? Nothing at all? - Wilbur! - How about a cream soda? - Now look! We need a flight to Australia! Australia? The land down under? That's a fabulous idea! So when can I pencil you in? Uh, after spring thaw? You know, mid-June would be very nice. Oh, no. We must leave tonight! Tonight? Come on. You're kiddin' me, right? Have you looked outside? It's suicide out there! Ho-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait. - What a bunch of jokers! - But you don't understand. A boy needs our help. He's in trouble! Boy? You mean, little kid kind of boy? - He was kidnapped! - Kidnapped? Oh, that-that's awful, lockin' up a little kid. Kids should be free... free to run wild through the house on Saturday mornings... free to have cookies and milk a-and get those little white moustaches, you know. Nobody's gonna take a kid's freedom away while I'm around! Nobody! You hear me? Does that mean you'll take us? Storm or no storm, Albatross Airlines at your service! Passengers are requested to please fasten their seat belts and secure all carry-ons. We'll be departing following our standard preflight maintenance. Thankyou.

Whoa! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Oh! Cowabunga! Captain, is this a nonstop flight to Australia? Well, uh, not exactly, no. Uh, I could definitely say no.

Breaker, breaker, little mate. I forgot to tellyou. Around here, you need to be quiet! Orthe Rangers might hear you. Now sit down and relax. Enjoy the view.

Ladies and gentlemen, flight 12 is now approaching Sydney Airport. Make sure your seat belts are fastened and the tables secured... and enjoyyour stay in Australia. - Are we there yet? - Yes. You know, perhaps we should wake up Wilbur. Oh, a-all right. I'll-I'll get him up. Uh, Wilbur? Wilbur? Wilbur! - Yeah. Just five more minutes, Ma. - Wilbur! That's all I need, five more minutes. - Wilbur, are you awake? - Get-- Get up! We're there! - Okay, I'm up, I'm up. - Watch out! You're-- Oh! I must've been sleepin' on a bolt. Oh, boy!

Comin' through, sir! Thankyou! Next stop, Mugwomp Flats! Did we lose anyone back there? Miss Bianca, f-from now on, can't-can't we just take the train? Well, Sparky, you've had this comin' for a long time... and now you're gonna get it. Wise fly. Mugwomp tower! Mugwomp tower! This is Albatross 1-3 requesting permission to land. Over. Albatross? Let's see. Finch, wren, scrub bird, lorikeet, freckled duck... galah, kookaburra, parrot, cockatoo, albatr-- Alba-Albatro-- It's-It's a jumbo! Negative, 1-3. You'll have to turn back. Our runway isn't long enough for a bird your size. Not long enough? Look, pal! I can land this thing on a dime! Uh, Wilbur, if-if the runway isn't long enough-- Listen, you can't let these radarjockeys push you around! Just leave it to me, all right? I say again, mate, our runway is too short. And I say again, mate, I'm comin' in! Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, we gotta find a way to extend the runway! - Here we go! - We'll-We'll never make it! Passengers, please remain seated... until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop. Thankyou. Whoa! Whoa! Quick, Sparky! We need to make a dragline! Whoa! Now don't try and tell me the runway's too short. Hold this for me, will ya, pal? Bloke oughta have his wings clipped. Your captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines. - Please gather all carry-ons. - Crazy Yanks. They think they can do any fool thing without regard for-- Oh, no. Welcome to Australia, ma'am. My name's Jake, and if there's any way I can make your stay more pleasant, don't hesitate to ask. - Oh, how kind. - Allow me to get that bag for you. I've, uh-- I've got a lot of, uh, luggage here. Here, let me give you a hand with those bags, pal. All part of the friendly service here at Albatross-- Ow! Oh-oh! Big-time hurt! - Ah, back! Oh, it's out! - Wilbur, are you all right? Don't worry, ma'am. I'll handle this. Sparky, you watch the tower. We gotta get this bird to the hospital. Can't go down, can't go up. Oh! Take the bags, take the bags. H-Hey, what are you doin'? Hey, w-what's goin' on? Wait! Hey, wait a minute! Just stop everything! Wilbur, don't worry. We'll come back the moment we find the boy. W-W-Wait! Hey, wait a minute! Don't leave me here, please! I'm feelin' much better now. I-I'm even ready to hit the beaches. I-I'm even ready to mambo. Doctor, will he be all right? Now, now, my dear, keep a stiff upper lip. They all come in with a whimper and leave with a grin. Off with you now. Leave everything to me. Shoo-shoo. Off you go. Hop to it, ladies. We've got a bent bird on our hands. Move, move, move. Bustle, bustle, bustle. That's it. - Will it-- Will it hurt, Doc? - Dear boy, you won't feel a thing. - Launch the back brace! - Hey! Hey, wait! Wait! Whoa! I've been skewered! I've already missed tea, Mr Albatross. Now don't force me to take drastic measures. - You must relax. - Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life! If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead! I'm not convinced. Sixty milligrams! Sixty milligrams. Hey, what-- Are you-- Are you guys crazy? You can't do that to me! I'm an American citizen, buddy! - Better double it! - Double? - Double, coming up. - No! Prepare the albatross for medication. I'm dreamin'! I'm dreamin'! Come on, Wilbur! Wake up, boy! Wake up! - Three degrees right! - Come on! - Three degrees right! - I got the joke! - Down two degrees! - Oh, no! Don't go down two degrees! - Down two degrees. - Ready! - No, I'm not ready! Don't, please! Aim! Oh, please don't do this to me! - Fire! - Ow! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Now we just gotta figure out how to get there. So, uh-huh, you and your, um, uh, husband here on a little outback excursion? Oh, no, no. We're not married. In fact, we're, uh-- we're here on a-a top, uh, secret mission. Very, very hush-hush. Oh. Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed, eh? Why, that's right! How did you know? You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback, miss. So, um, which way you takin', uh-- - Suicide Trail through Nightmare Canyon or the short cut at Satan's Ridge? Good choice. More snakes, but less quicksand. Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free. That is, until, uh, Dead Dingo Pass. Wait, wait, wait a minute. I don't-- I don't see any-any of that-that stuff on the map. A map's no good in the outback. What you really need is someone-- someone who knows the territory. Oh, Mr Jake, will you guide us? At your service! Here. Better take my arm, miss. It's gonna be a treacherous hike. I remember the time, Miss B, it was just me... and 400 of these big, giant possums. He doesn't even know how to fold a map. This is how we get around in the outback, Miss B. It's the only way to travel, eh, Berno? Uh, yeah, yeah. It's just a little b-- a little, uh, bumpy back here. Cinch up your seat belts, mates. We're comin' in for a landing. Hold-Hold it! Not-Not yet! Well, boy, let's see if we can do something... to refresh that rusty old memory of yours. Is she on Satan's Ridge... or Nightmare Canyon? What do you think,Joanna? Yeah, that's it. Right smack dab... in the middle at Croc Falls! - Am I gettin' warm? - I told you, I don't remember. Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune? I'll split the money with you fifty-fifty. You can't get a better offer than that, boy. You won't have any money after the Rangers get through with you. Jake's been gone-- Ow! Been gone a long time. Maybe I should go-- Oh! - Maybe I should go look for him. - Oh, don't you worry about Jake. He can handle himself. - Yeah, I-- I noticed. - I am just sure he'll be back in no time. You know, now that we're alone, there's-- there's something that I've, I've been wanting to, um, t-to askyou. Yes, what is it? Well, it's, uh, it's like this. Miss Bianca, I-- I would be most honoured if you-- Look out! No mice for you, Twister, not today! There! - M-Miss Bianca! - I've been lookin' all over for you. Now look. We got a long way to go... and you're gonna take us there. And you're not gonna give us any trouble about it. Right? They're perfectly harmless once you look 'em in the eye and let 'em know who's boss. Ain't that right, mate? Now git! It's all right, Bernard. Jake has everything under control. Yeah, I-- I noticed. You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told, I used to be quite a dingo wrestler. Yeah. There was this one time it was just me... and 300 of these ferocious mouse-eating dingoes. They had me surrounded. The sight of their teeth... was like a wall of ivory. I'll give you a night down here to think it over. But tomorrow... no more Mr Nice Guy! Come on,Joanna, you thickheaded chunk of fish bait! I'll never tell you where she is! Never! Never! Yeah, we'll never tell! You'll have to drag it out of us! - Hey, where did you come from? - Um, the desert? Well, well, well. Fancy that. Looks like McLeach has begun trapping his own kind. There's no hope for any of us now. - No hope? No hope? No! - But there must be a way out of here. Oh, there's a way out, all right. - There is? - There is? - Absolutely! You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt... and our dear Frank-- - No, no, no! I don't want to hear it! - Frank will go as-- I can't hear you! La, la, Mathilda, waltzing-- - A purse. - Oh, no! Oh, a lovely ladies' purse. I don't want to go as a purse! Please, please, don't let him do it. - Don't worry. We're gonna get out of here. - We are? Yeah. If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of something. - Yeah, something, something, something. Uh, yeah, yeah, uh-- - Frank, what's wrong? Oh, here he goes again. Take it easy, mate. You don't want to hurt yourself again. Ooh! Yeah, I got it! - All we gotta do is get the keys! - Oh, is that all? Well, then, we'd better start packing our bags. But wait! He's right! If we could get these long pieces of wood-- Wood! Yeah, wood, wood, wood! Good! Good! Maybe we could-- That's right. Just a little more. There! Come on, everybody. Get some more stuff! The kid's right. What are we waiting for? That's it! You've got it! Hurry! We need something to tie it together. Hey, hey, hey! What do ya got? What do ya got? What do ya got? Shoelaces, oh. Almost. - A little further. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - It's okay. Let's try again. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy. Easy does it. Now-- No, no, no, no-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no-- - Will somebody shut him up! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - We did it! - You got it! You got it! You got it! I got it! I'll just take my tail... and I'll pick the lock, like this! Aw, Frank, give it a rest. No, no, no. You'll thank me when you're free. Look, look, oh. I just insert my tail like this, and I turn it like this... just a quarter turn to the left, and then I push it a little bit further. And it's all in the timing, you see. You just push a little bit. And then you pull a little bit back. And then you push a little bit forward. And then you turn a little bit this way. Show him who's boss, Berno! I feel like I got my head in a vice. - Are we ready, nurse? - Ready, doctor. All right, ladies, snap to it! Ooh, that smarts. Oh, let me see here. - Forceps! - Forceps! Oh, no. What now? - Spinal streculator. - Oh! That's gonna hurt! - Artery router. - Mother! This is rusted tight. I wouldn't dream of using such a tool. Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter! The epidermal what? Oh, no. No! No! - Mr Albatross, we haven't operated yet! - Ya gotta catch me first, Doc! Mr Albatross, please! Cowabunga! Mr Albatross, we must return you to the operating room! You'll never take me alive! Please don't do this! Your spine needs tender... Ioving care! My-- My back. Hey. I can-- Hey, it works! I'm cured! My back! Don't worry! I'm comin', you little mice! This is the finest fleet on two webbed feet! Oh, boy! I gotta-- I gotta go on a diet when I get home. Here we go! ...in these particular areas. In other news... authorities in Mugwomp Flats have called offthe search for the missing boy. His backpack was found near Crocodile Falls... and local Rangers believe he was yet another victim of crocodile attack. Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution-- Think you're pretty smart, don't ya? Huh? Who outsmarted who? Who-- Who outsmarted who, huh? I still gotta get that boy to talkin', huh? I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach. Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs! Everyone's got his price. All I gotta do is offer him whatever he wants... and then not give it to him. Did you take one of my eggs? Open your mouth. These are not Joanna eggs! Let's see. The boy's got the eagle. I want the eagle. The boy won't give me the eagle. If I could just find the boy's weak spot... I could get him to tell me where the eagle is. But the boy's only got one weak spot, and that is the eagle. Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill... that would loosen his tongue, and then I got him! Got your hand caught in the cookie jar, didn't you? Who do you thinkyou're messing with, you dumb animal? My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain! Joanna, I give you platypus eggs. I give you snake eggs. Why, I'll even give you eagle eggs. But I want you to stay away from my-- The eagle's eggs. That's it! That's the boy's weak spot! And then you push a little bit farther, and you take it back a little bit... and then you turn it once more around. And then you take it back, and then you-- I give up! I'll never get this. We're doomed! Doomed. Hey, look, Krebbs! Frank's out. - Frank, Frank, you're free! - I'm free? I'm free! I'm free! I'm free! I'm free! - Shh! Joanna will hear! - Free, free! Free, free, free, free! - Double or nothing, he's caught in five minutes. - I'm free! I'm free, free, free, free! - Free, free, free, free, free! - Calm down, little mate! What did I tell ya? Look at me! I'm free! - Frank, get the keys. - I-- I should get the keys! - Ah, I'm stuck! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! - Shh! Keep quiet! - Quiet, ya fool! - I'm stuck! I'm stuck! - Take it easy. I'll get you loose. There you go. Now, go get the keys. The keys. Yeah, yeah. Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys. - Hey, I can't reach 'em. - Quick, get something to stand on. - Yeah, stand on. Somethin' to stand on. - This ought to be rich. Yeah, yeah. Stand on. Stand on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Frank! - Frank! - Huh? - Use the box. Climb up on the box. - Box. The box. Of course, the box. The box. - Shh! - Be quiet. - But these darn things are heavy. Oops. Aaah! The keys, Frank! Give us the keys! Frank, over here! Give us the keys! Yee-haa! Ride 'im, Frank! Yahoo! Howdy, howdy, howdy! Howdy, howdy, howdy! Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in! Aah! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! Missed. Surprise! If I didn't know any better, I'd thinkyou didn't like it here. Let me go! Let go! Let go! Ah, what are you doing out of your cage? Well, that's better. Come on, boy. Say goodbye to your little friends. It's the last you'll ever see of 'em. There is no time to waste. We must try to get in. Here-- Here, Miss Bianca. Start digging. Has anyone considered trying "open sesame"? - Whoa! - Hey, it worked! Get out of here! Go on! Git! - Look, Bernard. It's the boy! - And McLeach. It's all over, boy. Your bird's dead. Someone shot her. Shot her, right out of the sky! Bang! - No! - What do you mean, no? You callin' me a liar? I heard it on the radio this morning. And she could have been mine if it weren't for you. Now you better get out of here before I change my mind! Go on, git! - Why is he letting him go? - It's gotta be a trick. Too bad about those eggs, eh, Joanna? They'll never survive without their mother. Oh, well. Survival of the fittest, I guess. Bingo! - Bird? - Eggs? Shhh! Listen. I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing. I don't know where he's going, but we can't let him get away. - Hurry up, you two! - Quickly, Bernard, now! Oh, no! Oh, no!Jump! Get between the treads! Oh, whoa! Bernard, Bianca! Here, catch! Got it! M-M-Miss-- Miss Bianca, y-you can do it! Boy, this is some headwind, huh? Whew! Ooh. S-Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen... two little mice running around down there, would you? Hey, where are ya goin'? I-I mean it. I'm looking for two little mice. Is it something I said? He's goin' down the cliff. Come on. We gotta warn him. - Cody? - Huh? Who are you? Oh, there is no time to explain. You are in great danger. Marahute? It can't be. Oh, Cody! Cody, wait! - She's alive! - Cody, please! - You must listen. - That's ri-- That's right. Mc-McLeach is on the cliff. Marahute! No! Turn back! Turn back! Stay away! It's a trap! I got her! I got her! Did you see that? Perfect shot. Perfect shot! She's mine. All mine! No! Hold tight, you two. We're goin' for a ride. - Bianca! - Bernard! That meddlin' brat! I'm gonna get rid of him for good. - Help! I'm slipping! - Cody, don't move. There she is,Joanna. Just look at her. Look at the size of her. The rarest bird in the world. That bird's gonna make me rich. Filthy rich. I got what I want. Now, what does Joanna want? Does she want to make sure that bird stays rare? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. - Huh? How 'bout some great big triple-A jumbo eagle eggs? Huh? You want 'em? Huh? You want 'em? Go get 'em! No! Please! Why, whatever's the matter,Joanna? Get movin'! Joanna, you hurry up and eat those eggs! And get your tail up here! Move it! Yeah! Okay, you guys. She fell for it. Looks like the coast is clear. Girls? Girls, I'm here! Where are you, you little chickies, you? Wilbur? Wilbur! Don't ever do that to me again! Oh, boy! I lost a lot of feathers on that one. Wilbur, am I glad to see you. - Give me a hand with these eggs, will ya? - Yeah, sure. Wait a minute. What the heck are you doin' up here, anyway? The kidnapper took the boy and Jake and Miss Bianca. Miss Bianca? Miss Bianca's in trouble? Whoa! Hey, well, that's, that's terrible. W-We got to do something. Bernard, I'm disappointed in you. Hiding under a nest while Miss Bianca needs our help. - I gotta talk to you, mister. - Wilbur. I-I-I-I-- You should start searching the desert for her. And I-- I-I-I-I-- I'll scan the coastline! - Wilbur. - That's what I'll do. I'll let the chicks on the beach-- - Wilbur! - Huh? What? Now listen. There are some chicks right here that need your help.
