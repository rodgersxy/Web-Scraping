Cinema TV5 Camera without a visa Welcome to all. Farouk Beloufa's Nahla is a cult movie of the Algerian cinema. and it's director whose work has always been hindered or confined to underground screenings... enjoys a considerable reputation... owed to artists whose talent never compromised. The story of Nahla is set in Lebanon in the middle of the 70's... where an Algerian journalist meets three women. A journalist, a Palestinian activist and Nahla the singer... who suddenly loses her voice during her concert. How and what can one sing as the civil war is raging? The script written in collaboration with Rachid Boudjedra... Describes with terrible and magnificent lucidity... the mechanism of the great contemporaneous Arabic confusion... the tragedies and the excesses that it generates. But it also acts on us as a premonition today... of the atrocious civil war that hit Algeria 10 years after the movie came out. Nahla uses the symbol of the voice suddenly sentenced to silence... and plays on the nostalgia of an era when sung feelings could be heard. It is the film of a seer who looks at what will happen... and refuses the blindness that some will try to impose on him. Note that Moufida Tlatli, the excellent Tunisian movie maker... whose films like 'The Silences of the Palace' have conquered the audience... took care of Nahla's editing. And since this Arabic movie offers women all the space they deserve... Farouk Beloufa couldn't find better qualified. I'm so taut! So tense! "Relax, girl!" That's what Maha would say... What is it I have? The fever back again. Where has Maha gone? She disappeared, of course... I miss her so bad... I don't know anymore... Things are out of my control... I wish I could talk to someone... But to whom? I can't believe all that has happened. Nahla or the sinking city Bring the camera. Camera one, ready! Silence! It's the play-back issue again! - She can't do that again! - Watch the other camera, Selim! Be ready for the 2nd try! How do you feel? Do you need anything? Take the camera down... Let's do it once again. Bring the camera. Attention, camera. How could all these things happen. What does all that mean? Hurry up! Someone you are close to, that you would like to talk about... Yes, my grand-mother was living... This is off-topic! And you never met her! What do you care? Okay! Well, let's come back to the point. Nahla! Ready for the generic? Salim, you're soon. Turn your back. Video ready. salim ready. Nahla ready. Play-back ready. Everything ready? OK? Let's go. Production Radio Télévision Algérienne (RTA) And on the other hand, the Lebanese Press declared... that the Israeli Army is going to attack the whole region in a few hours. Kafr Chouba, in the South, symbolize the "Kunaitre" for the Arabs, around 1975. We salute the glorious fighters... who brought back dignity to our Arab Nation... with their fight, their support and challenges... in the face of the Zionist, Nazi attacks... devoid of all mercy and humanity. The silence of the Arab States about the situation... can only point to a plot against our dear South. The inhabitants of Kafr Chouba have fled to Marjaïoum and Nabatieh. They do not know what their fate will be. A person close to the Lebanese government said yesterday... that they won't help since the fight is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. What do you think? People say that the (Lebanese) government has no control in the South. because of the Palestinian presence there, is that true? the interests of the Lebanese people and those... of the Palestinian people are the same, you can't dissociate them. And Cairo agrees with that. You do not answer to my question. Is it true that Kfar Chouba is under communist control? Palestinian or Lebanese, communist or socialist... it doesn't matter since the citizens of this land have a one fight... they have one enemy, the Israeli Zionism. Smoke Marlboro, the cigarettes in the red and white pack... Marlboro. Yaser Arafat, the chairman of the Fatah organization, said he expects... the outbreak of a fifth war in the Middle East... if this explosive situation that afflicts South Lebanon is not appeased. What are you trying to achieve with all these things? You know what? When I think about Nabil I wonder the same thing. Who are you talking about? Nabil or Nahla? Do you need something? I going to the kiosk. Give this to Michel. Nahla! What's up? I should have called you long ago but... No, it would be better if we meet. We have to. I will be the one calling you. Rubric "Shows". Who really cares of that? If we don't pay, there is no ad. We have to make an effort with all the magazines. Logrolling... Listen to me carefully. We need someone who is close to Nahla. Someone who knows and likes her, of course. Someone who understands "the sensitivity of her audience". Someone who can sell her with style. We don't need demagogic schemes. Only you can handle this task. You're right, but I'll pass. Forget it. Let's think about it from a different point of view. This singer, Nahla... Where does she come from? What does she represent? How does she dance and sing? - How do people sense her? - This is interesting! Further more... it would help her work on her personality, her style. I got it right, but it's still no. You are impossible. "Now that the days of winter are gone..." "that the days of snow are gone..." "he who has gone..." "he who has left..." "I wish he who has escaped..." "will come back and we'll be kids again." "I will read the books again..." "I will live in that house again..." "I'll gather firewood around..." "and lit the fire." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me secrets, secrets." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me secrets, secrets." "I don't know what happened to him." I can exchange this, no problem. This is Beyrouth! We can buy or sell everything. Even the Devil if you want! I will take him, exchange him, and sell him to you! You won't even notice. By the way, the Dinar is not worth more than the Franc? You surprise me. Looks like you know nothing about it. I know it's hard to, but stop looking at the money like this! Michel, did someone ever pointed a gun at you? Me, no. But the one I'm replacing... Some guys attacked him. They made an agreement and shared the money! They all ran away together. Hurry up, Raouf! She just left... in a black car with ther mother! Go, you can still catch them! She had a long face! It looked liked she had swallowed a sweep. Do you think I will believe that? I told you to hurry! He completely fell for her! He left like a rocket! I bet he will end up wrecked, he's crazy! I got you! What? She was wearing dark glasses too. By the way, are you going to see Hind? Tell her to take me here. Let's go... we're late! See you. Hello. Welcome, you can go. Good. I will wait for you guys here. Do you recognize this voice? This old man, he's been like this for 12 years, totally lost. Since he's been like this he hasn't said a word. Hind is here! - How are you doing today? - Good. And you? Come in, have a seat. Thank you, another time. Anything new? Not yet. I will tell you as soon as something happen. I haven't heard from my brother neither. Wait for me, I'll be here in ten minutes. Larbi, do you see this patch of sky? Last year, two planes appeared there. - Phantoms? - No, another type. The harassment lasted four hours. People were terrorized and tried to hide. There was a boy in panic there. Fleeing. All of a sudden he froze and started spitting. He walked back and he fell. Then he started over and fell again. You are not a professional photographer. You're sharp! I look at you and you're not in a rush to take pictures. Don't worry, nobody will know it... Don't worry, nobody will know it... Sing out when the music amplifies, okay? "Take me with you my love." "let's go for a walk." Let's start over. Hit it with this main idea. 1, 2, 3... "Take me with you my love." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me your secrets." What is it? You've been in the same troop for 3 years... and you never discussed things clearly. I being fed up with you! What I have trouble understanding is how you can spend your time... complaining about the American, and not be able to live without their tobacco. Did you notice the way I crush their cigarettes? - Where did you get this from? - I don't know, it was unused. That's so him! He meddles in things he doesn't understand. This genius... He jumped from a plane to another. He's making so many efforts for his single goal, have them all around a table. And who will pay the bill? I bet we will! Hind, why don't you stay here a few days? I'm sure he will call at some point. - Who? - Nabil. Quit this job! I would have done it long ago. You have no interest in it! Be a journalist again. Did you ever feel you were drowning, in deep water, unable to float back? And sometimes numb for days or weeks, hours... or all the time. It was so bad it took me an hour to peel this apple. On top of that, Rafiq ate it. The worst is I realize it but can't do anything about it. We see go coming and going, moving, bustling... But inside you there is nothing but a sleepwalker. This idiom is incredible: "It makes him melt like sugar!" Do you know what Nabil told me just before he left? "You know what is Cognac is for?" "These candles... Why not make peace?" "Let's start over. Why not have a baby?" A baby? Six years later? You have to be able to follow him. Before, he was afraid. Afraid of constraints. Of being stuck. To top it all, my mother thought... I was the one that didn't want a baby! How could I think he would react differently? Sharing, love... simple things! What can you expect from life apart from that? What else is there? Do you know what he answered? "Everything you say is true." "But I can't. I can't do anything about that." Nabil! The most incredible thing is that now... I don't want to hear about him. I can't take it anymore. Even if he thinks it harms him, I'm free. I'll take care of it. She is not here. "I wish he who has escaped..." "will come back and we'll be kids again." "I will read the books again..." "I will live in that house again..." "I'll gather firewood around..." "and lit the fire." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me secrets, secrets." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me your secrets." What do you think of it? Not bad. I don't agree. The lyrics are hollow. Nabil is complaisant and inefficient, what can I do? It doesn't matter. I'll go to the room. It should be finished soon. Call me at the bank, around 10 AM. Try to take a picture of her, like this. Nahla! Your profile. So troublesome! Just one picture, with a severe look, like this. Do you get it? - You don't seem to enjoy it. - What a pain. Idiot! I didn't understand Repeat! You really annoy me! Didn't you understand already? You hate me? This is not a scoop, nothing new about it. Sorry, I didn't know. What you did was not very nice. Can I have my bag? It wasn't smart... Really not. Keep this distance. And try to avoid hissings. She's not easy to deal with. Why? Is she scornful? Didn't you notice how she looks us up and down? If you examine the situation, the battle of Kfar Chouba is a defeat... for those who don't want us here. You need to understand something. Until now, the Israeli army served the Lebanese right wing. But now the right wing has to take over. It is no longer the resistance fighting against Israel... now, all South-Lebanon is concerned. And this, despite the reactions after "Black September"? There are things you need to understand first... As long as we fight the Israeli enemy, Lebanon tolerates us. The Lebanese right wing is weakened... They need to solve the issue with the left wing. because they think they are responsible for their fragility. The lack of reaction of the Arab countries is not unjustified. The truth is, this is the problem... and depending on the situation, we either hindering... or triggering the situation. Do you know that Soleiman is Palestinian? Born and raised in Palestine. He owns properties there. He hopes to return when Palestine will be liberated. Are you serious? I'm serious. Why wouldn't it be possible? The head of the intra-bank is Palestinian. True. And how did you and your friends got rid of him? Ah! Maha! How are you? Me? I can't stand this bank anymore. Where is Nabil? He didn't come? Too bad for him... Come with me, I have a surprise for you. Who took this picture? Who? I will pull out his eyes. Here he is. - Is this your picture? - No, it's yours. You're a comic too! Wait, let him explain. It is not ill-intentioned, I swear. I'm glad I met you, and honestly, what's wrong with this? Where did you find this guy? What dialect does he speak? He comes from Alger. Algerian, what do I care? We have to head towards a new world, more modern. We need to give Nahla a lighter look, frivolous and charming. Don't we, Nahla? Of course! Don't you understand it's a game of patience? Of course, but this game can destroy us. You only shuffle the cards. We are the ones who play. Mr Mahfouz, don't you think I like your country? I didn't find her. It's her headlong rush... Just like somebody jumping in the water to avoid the rain. I'm very happy for your TV show. I made an agreement with Soleiman. So, Abu Dhabi in April, then... Qatar and from there we will go to London. And there... we will spend countless money. How much, do you think? My sister Maha will come with us, right? Well, why not? - I'd say it will cost... - Let me tell you. Enough to dress, feed, and equip an armada! Even finance it. As aggressive as ever. She hates the whole world! See how your presence boosted her morale? Is everything fine? I'm mad in joy, can't you see? Still lonely? I don't feel particularly lonely. Why? Do you? If something had to happen, it would have happened already. We often meet. We're here and... No, no it's bothers me. What do you mean? It's like a humming. Yes, a flies humming, here, in my head. Do you get it? We are tempted to open to everything... Just like that, for no reason. It scares me. What do you mean? It annoys you. Are you mad at me? I have to go, really I can't stay here. You're not mad at me, are you sure? Lebanon was a peaceful and stable place... After what happened, it's all upset. One of the two sides broke the balance. Who broke it? Who are you talking about, Nasri? Nobody, now, can deny the balance is lost. And who is responsible? What's gotten into you? I'm just calmly chatting. The question is simple: Whose fault is it? In any case, it's not mine. You are formidable. You're always so self-righteous. so dry and repelling. Do you know why? To hide your personal problems. Do you hear that, Larbi? What is it about? Political or personal issues? Do you think we are talking about your personal problems? And I'm still waiting for an answer. Calm down! I'm concerned, that some means of action... are uncalled for and inefficient. You, really, are such a joke! Why don't you say it clearly? Why make insinuations? Aren't you talking about the Palestinians? And what efficient solution are you thinking about? Actually it repulses you. - Me? - Absolutely! To be honest and not hide anything from you, I'm not related at all with all this bullshit. Where are you going? Why avoid the question? What are you fleeing? Help me understand. What do you care about all this? Why blame me for the responsibilities you are unable to take? Why me? The work, Nabil, Nahla... what esle? Whatever you touch is instantly rotten. Do you know why? You should think about that at least once in your life! - In your place... - You, in my place... How could it be possible? You, in my place... Please, this is not the right moment. Why? Is there a better occasion? By the way, tell me... When you swallow your saliva, don't you poison yourself? Please, don't go too far. Don't forget it's Nahla's party. Look how he runs away. He is fleeing. He avoids confrontation, it scares him. Who was Nabil? My husband. A mistake, I think. Sometimes I wonder... Remind me to buy candles. They used to be pious. Do you remember this girl, Ghadda? What happened to her? She followed the wrong path. God, what a marvel! This is not a face she has but a radiant moon! The one in red, imagine her in vamp! I'm falling for them. Terrible! Calm down. One last effort... Dear listeners, we are pleased to... welcome tonight... the young and talented singer Nahla. She will soon perform a recital at the Piccadilly. She will sing new songs to the audience in Beirut. First, a few questions to introduce you. First of all, the Arab world is mourning. Recently, the great Oriental star, Oum Keltoum, left us. Now, young and new talents are competing... to try to fill the void she left. Is it your ambition too? No, filling a void is not what I'm trying to achieve. I don't thing to compete with anybody. The only thing I care about is people valuing my voice. By the way, I don't think.... anyone can replace Oum Keltoum or Asmahan. This is not what journalists seem to think. They pretend... you are the singer of the younger generation. What do you think of that? It's hard to say... I hope so. What do you hope? Whatever you say is alright with me. I think I'll go out and come in again! It's just... It's too good to miss! Thank you for being here, and... I love you! Maha noticed my absences. She didn't miss that. She tried to talk about it. I refused but I don't know why. Only a few minutes left! Time's over. Where is Soleiman? His face changed when the workers' representatives arrived. He can't support that. Who gave them invitations? When he will see them tomorrow, in line in front of him... Well, I'll go. If you have nothing better to do... "Now that the days of winter are gone..." "that the days of snow are gone..." "he who has gone..." "he who has left..." "I wish he who has escaped..." "will come back and we'll be kids again." "I will read the books again..." "I will live in that house again..." "I'll gather firewood around..." "and lit the fire." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me secrets, secrets." "Take me with you my love..." "let's go for a walk." "You'll tell me secrets, secrets." "I don't know what happened to him." Let me get off here. Don't worry, the most important now is to sleep. I'll take care of Soleiman tomorrow. If he says a word, he'd better be careful! Try to sleep, it's urgent. We'll see tomorrow. What about Mom? I don't know. Sleep now. Where are you going? - I don't know. - No way! I don't want to talk about it now. All of this is false! Do you think I will believe this? Do you? I heard she stopped her recital. Too bad, she is so surprising. And her voice is unusual. The hair have to dry first or it won't work. - What's going on? - I'm taking care of her. Is something wrong? I come to see Miss Nahla, she called me. - I'll see if she's here. - She just called. Look at this mess. See what they did? Why are you staring at me like this? You look like those volunteer students. Full of enthusiasm, idealist, going to the countryside... to help peasants' cooperatives. What do those scatterbrained students do? They help. and I didn't say they are scatterbrained. But you look like a guy difficult to... Everything is changing so fast! I'm going to the printing house, do you need something? We are very late. - You'll have to explain yourself. - Very soon. Your husband is here. - Stop joking. - I'm serious. What's the matter? What's wrong? Do you have a minute? One moment. Ali... I just wanted to tell you I decided to go back to Egypt. What do you think? I'm not sure. It sounds like you are inviting me to go with you. What if I am inviting you? What? I'm telling you about an important decision and you... Please wait for me in the stairs. Let me finish this. Let me see. Is it a joke, Hassan? It's unreadable! What? About Nabil... are you sure things are so bad between you? Life's a bitch! You did all you could so he ditched you. Aren't I right? Still, he asks you to join him... and you refuse! You're trying to hide it but... both of us know you are avoiding this topic. I forgot to call Rafiq... He must be mad! Why don't you want to talk about it? What are you afraid of? Tell me, how many times did you say... "What do you care?" There are so many people saying about you... "She sank... But what do we care?" I was just asking... I try to understand how you keep up with this. I can't do that. You again? I always come before you! In Paradise too, I hope! Funny! Weren't you supposed to sleep at Maha's tonight? It's not what really matters to Raouf. Exact. By the way, Nahla didn't promise anything. I can't get it. Who's talking of Nahla now? Yes, who? You, him. And him and the other one! And when you don't, it's even worse. What I do know is... and you can't admit it, that you don't exist for her. You are leftovers! By the way, anything to eat? Hind doesn't even know me. Why put me with them? You said it yourself, you barely sleep! Don't hide the track, Michel! I have insomnia, that's all. If their point of view is not good, why care about it? Care for a coffee? Yes please, if there is some. You can definitely hedge! Me? The real experts are on the other side. And now Egypt stopped fighting... "Who hides behind his finger's shadow". You'll see what happen tomorrow. What will happen? A flower on the hat! He doesn't realize the stream carries it. That's so him, isn't it? Hind is right when she says... one day we will regret our immigration policy. But where will the Coup come from? In any case, the price will be high. It's suspect you agree on so many things today. Didn't you confirm the interview? As usual, you don't close the doors. I won't stay long. - It's for soon, be patient. - What do you mean? The journalist for Le Monde had to wait more than a week. I closed it for you anyway, that door. You look excited. I see your eyes shinning. I bet you had good time yesterday. Shut up! Stop talking about sex. So early and you are already under the belt. And on top of that you read this rag! No wonder you work here. Just be sure there is no "hole" in your cashier. And I'm the one always referring to sex? I'm bored of your "hole" and "cashier" story. Control yourself, Marcel. Raise the game! Raise my game? He seems intrigued by this thing. I'd like start over. To be honest, I realized... I was fooled. It's true. It's over. Is this what you wanted to explain? You forget easily. Because I want to. Do you understand something of this? I understand you are not in your best condition. I wonder why I told you that. - I'm leaving! - Already? I have to get up at 6. I'm going to Tripoli, Adnan disappeared. When? A few days ago. He was supposed to arrive by boat. We waited for him but... We don't know if he was kidnapped or if it's something else. It's been five days we haven't heard from him. Actually it's not that you don't want to sing. You can't! You can't understand that. But it's obvious. How can you be so blind? You? You are trying to convince me of such a thing? Don't you understand why I'm trying to avoid you? God, how can we end this? Something happened to me. In Amman, in September, when all these horrors took place. I was talking to a 25 year-old boy who miraculously survived. He couldn't even cry his eyes out. I don't know if you can realize that. He was there, sobbing like a baby, and I was looking at him... Unmoved. I didn't feel anything. On the contrary, I felt like I was the one in need of care. I'm telling you this and I'm having goosebumps. Good evening. I'm here for Michel. I was told he is here. Michel, someone is looking for you! Marcel? What are you doing here? We need to talk, it will be quick. - Something serious? - No, it's nothing. What is it about? Let's go outside, it will be better. Is it very urgent? Why don't you come with me? It's nice of you, but my friends are up there. Why is Nahla up there? It was Hind, I'm so dumb! This has nothing to do with Hind. Anyway, what are these vanished 2.000£? Stop lying to me. I exchanged Deutsche Marks then I exchanged Francs. You follow me? I put the money in the cashbox. How it disappeared? Mystery! One more mystery. It's clearly a mystery. - I ran into debts to pay it back. - Run into debts? This story fell on me, it's incredible! How troublesome, incredible! Kicking your heels again? As usual. This way, take this road. If he saw Michel hurt, Raouf won't be able to control himself. We will find him in this restaurant. He often comes here. Slow down. No, he doesn't seem to be here. Turn here, right. Raouf, get on! Where are you going? What are you going to do? Raouf, stop, calm down. Let's try to understand what happened! Get on, come on! Give me your gun. Enough! Give him your gun. Do you understand what's going or don't you? - I'm begging up, give it to him! - No! What are you trying to do, what do you want to do? So we will let them shoot us and not retaliate. We will stay still and encourage them to shoot us! - Do you know who did it? - Who? Even if you do, don't you think it was provocation? Don't you see it is a trap? I need to shoot somebody! You don't realize the situation. Give us your gun! Yesterday, on the 26th February, in Saïda a bloody demonstration... Palestinians workers had joined took place. The army interposed. 16 persons died. Amongst the demonstrators, Deputy Maarouf Saad... was killed by a bullet. The tension is rising in Saïda, after the funerals of Maarouf Saad. What's going on? How could I know? It's like I am wrecked... I am ashes! Actually... But the situation suddenly and brutally changed. What do you really think? The ideas of your fascists friends are terrifying! No wonder you can't stand me. Just, calm down. Let me go. I want to go. I feel empty, exhausted. I can't take it anymore. What are you doing here? Do you realize what happened to me? I come back from the port. Yesterday, late at night, someone called me. "Have a look at the boat". It's full of guns! Imagine all these guns in front of me! I called Soleiman and he told me... "So what? It's not the first time it happens." I saw them with my own eyes! And the other one told me... "Even if there were there..." What do you mean "Even if"? Here, in Beirut, guns! Before me eyes! And tanks! I am completely lost. How can you be surprised Soleiman told this kind of things? We were supposed to receive cows and that's your reaction! I understand your problem. You're afraid your children lack milk. It's too easy. Weren't you the one saying... business and politics are two different things? What world do you live in? Wake up! I'm talking about tanks! Fire! Don't you interfere! There's nothing I can do for you. And never do that again. Never! I never asked you anything. You introduced me to Soleiman! And you always send me crash my skull on a wall! Because you are so good at it! - You can even do it on your own. - Okay, I get it now. I won't do foolish things. I'm tired of your useless papers. It's okay for the interview. We just need to confirm the date. What's new is Alger? What's the weather like? A nacreous lute? Loony! Only that? I'm penniless! Well... Belkacem, greet everybody for me. King Fayçal of Arabia passed away today. He was deadly shot... by his nephew, Emir Massaad. Official sources in Ryad... reported it was in fact an assassination. Waiting for more informations, here are a few quick reminders. Who was Emir Fayçal? We know he insisted in his declarations... He had demanded the return of Jerusalem to the Arabs at the end of the 1967 war. Today, the question is... Does this offer new perspectives of peace? Details about the circumstances of Fayçal's death... and reactions in Arab countries and all over the world... in our next newscast. You didn't drink your tea. If it's cold I can make a new one. Do as you wish. What's this din in the street? You don't realize. It may explode like dynamite! It's a very bad idea to keep Nahla in your place. I know. By the way... Aren't you the one behind the arms trafficking? What? I'm looking for someone with short hair. He's been here for 4 days. Are you Maha? 4 days? Yes, I see. He came here with a fever. He's better now. We are overcrowded, we can't keep him. Which room? Charkaoui Ziad, room 105. You arrive only now. I'm bored of being locked up! I couldn't even call you. How did you end up here? Why didn't you go home? I was walking and... Michel told me... It was Tuesday, I think. That day after the boat full of guns. I was walking and I collapsed in the street. I ended up here and they told me I had a peritonitis. It's not true. I don't trust them. Do you see this nurse over there? She won't let me out, I'm sure of it. Nabil, don't worry and calm down. It's over. It's what they told you. But once you leave... Did you bring your car? Take my belongings but don't let anybody see you. Tomorrow, tomorrow! Why tomorrow? Are you gaining time? If there is someone else in your life, tell me. You can tell me. I have to ask you. Someone has to get me out of here. But if you have something else to do... What else? You have your life and I have mine. If someone looks for me, Soleiman or... You didn't see me. You don't know where I am. Give me a smoke. Are you still smoking? Nabil, please. Maha, you're not lying to me, are you? Why would I? Beirut, 13th April 1975, 2:30 P.M. Wounded people! Rafiq! - Where do they come from? - A bus was attacked! Go out, go out! They are crazy! They didn't even spare the children! Maha! I can't wait until tomorrow! Watch out! Slowly. Hurry up, quick! The government assembled and agreed on a package of decisions... so as to stop the violence, restore security in the streets and apprehend the culprits. Larbi is hiding in his hotel room. He came to see us one day and gave us some news... about Michel, who went back to the South . Larbi made an effort to appear relaxed but his behaviour sold out his panic. Maha is remaining silent, especially since Nabil left. We are two shadows avoiding each other. It's unbearable! Maha! Why are you so distant, cold and indifferent? I knew you were gonna call. No, don't ask anything. I want to restart, start over. Don't you care about that. No, let me do it on my own! All of this was useless. What is "all of this"? I must be dreaming for sure. All you have to do now... is to kill me! Since you insist... Let's record it if you want to. Yes, let's record it. We'll see what we can do with it. There's something I don't understand. Ready? I feel like regressing. I used to be more confident. Not anymore. Way less. It's disturbing to see Oum Keltoum on TV. Why do you keep listening to me? I know what you think... It's "bullshit". Actually you don't understand. You can't. Do you understand that? Can you feel it? When she sings "Ah". She was right... to leave us that way. Say something! Get out. Don't you understand? Idiot! Even Maha... didn't accept. Always strong, tough... Don't you realize what you're doing? I have no memory, I don't remember. You're searching... searching? What are you looking for? Actually, it's all about you! Aren't you sleeping? I'm disturbed. You let me talk... You let me tell you. I say nothing... Nothing. You hear me? I'm pretending, yes... It's all the same. I'm coming down. It doesn't matter. 6:00, 6:15. Maha, I have to come. Wait a second. Hello? Maha? - To Ras-Nabaa! - Impossible! Wait, wait! El Hout street, okay? You are crazy! The place is full of shooters! They have all gone crazy! When things settle down, I'll open a shop here. Ya Allah! Please send us one! Anything new would be good. Waiting is so boring. Do you hear? Look there... is he dead? Where has the man gone? - A shooter! - Up there! Look what's coming. I'm a journalist. Do you have your papers? Come here! To enjoy the sweetness of life better, to ease your pains and sufferings, try... Try dungarees... Drop this and have some rest! No, I have to finish this first. What about the newscast about the incidents in Chiah? Set up your alarm at 3 and go to sleep! You will wake me up. Impossible! See the mess we are in! Hey guys, the war wounded is back. Larbi? Again! What are you doing here? I wonder too... Trying to make a call. Beirut? No, the Central then abroad. It will take at least three hours. The news? It's still very tense in Chiah this morning. - Where are you now? - Here! You're good at being in serious troubles. - Up already? Go to sleep. - I can't sleep. Good evening Michel. You recovered? I have a message for you. What is it again? I went to the headquarters. I heard your house was stricken. Only a bunch of rocks remains. Were you still living there? No, I'm living with friends. But my belongings were there. Michel, how is it for you there? More and more difficult. I'll tell you. Have you seen Raouf recently? Yes, he's beginning to reason himself. I have something for Hind. You often see her, right? Could you give her a note? - Maha, phone. - Coming! Joseph, did you see the telex? Larbi, don't worry. I will solve your problem. We're lucky to be safe here, aren't we? Yeah, I know that. How are things going for you? It is quite calm here. Wait, I'll call you again. It seems I was wrong. - Give this to Hind! - I promise. Nahla? Nahla? I'm happy to see you. Are you being sheltered here? Yes, but I'm going on a trip soon. Come with me. Do you remember? I wanted to make a tour for the princes. Here we are, I'm doing it. You know... I improved my skills. I was misled. The Picadilly was not for me. That was a mistake. I am not Soheir. Nahla, what is it? What's happening to you? Can you hear me? Larbi! How are you doing? What are the news? She's travelling! Really? This is very far from us! I am furiously going... where I'm going. Why are you talking like that? Why? As he was stepping on his foot, he started frowning at him. The other one wouldn't move. Finally, he said to him: "I beg you to remove your foot." The other: "Why? Are you getting off the bus?" We are alright. But on the other side... They are in a much better situation, don't you think? They always take initiatives. They always surprise us. And we are always overran. What are you talking about? Yes, they were ready before us. It's true. So what? It's easy to say, but... Don't you see the conditions we live in? Sometimes, I can't stand it anymore. I can't see anything anymore. But I'm hanging on! Don't stick to meaningless details. See their dynamics, their purview, I don't know... Where are you at? Me? You don't let me say a single word! So, it is fixed? What? There is not one plane ticket before 15 days? What about a car? No gas! I will call you again. Thank you. - Nothing? - Nothing. Tough time. Don't you see our country is burning? What should I do? What you should do? Thrice I found a place for you! You managed to lose them all . What? The first time, the car was going to Damascus. Then... I must leave, I want to leave. You want to... You want to... If you knew what I want... You don't realize... how low you fell. What is it again? The was the last thing we needed! It's okay, be patient. I bringing some light. Maha! Look... Read this! Here, Larbi! You want to leave, right? Either you want it or not, it will be the same. We will have to replace this oversleeve. Look at this: signature of the Sinaï Agreement. So what? Change all this... Wait a minute, Samir. Remove this. This is useless! Just throw it away and move this column. Where's Samir? Isn't your friend Michel in the neighbourhood's Committee? Yes, that's him. Tell him all the garbage piling in the building are stinking. Samir, people can solve their own problems! You go tell him. You're a grown-up! Also, the water is cut... and the water pipes are blocked. Here, it would be better to move this. And you throw all this away. Larbi, you will soon leave. I promise... we will find a way. What's wrong with them? One, two... Three... Four... Five... One month ago there was one rocket an hour. Now it's every minute... Things escalated. Where will this bomb fell? Christ! There is only one thing left: throw bombs to our faces. Then we can be annihilated. Everything will end at once. Are you getting better? Can I do something? You know, it would be safer to stay in the dining room. Let's all sleep on this side. Even if Raouf jibs. It would be better to go to another neighbourhood. It was already very difficult to move in here. - What is it? - I forgot again... I had to go to the Embassy. The Embassy? Everyday you call them to have an appointment... and you don't go. They will say they don't want to hear from you anymore. Probably. Nobody moved the garbage down? Lord, enough of the horrors! Let us love each others. What, were you praying? It's the first time I see you praying. Why? Why do I need to tell you? Where did he find water? Nobody needs the radio? So I will be using it. What's going on? Why this silence? Was a baby girl born?
