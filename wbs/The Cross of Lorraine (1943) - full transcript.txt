Overnight, our great French army was mobilized. 5 million of us. We came from every corner of the land. In the village of Cadignan, resting in the foothills of the maritime alps, the widow Marchand's son Ren? was too young for conscription. Ren? told his mother he was going to the market. How could she know he was running away to fight for France? From a distant town of La Chambre came Jacques Batrue. His barbershop was also the local Monte Carlo. From his beloved farm in the Rh?ne Valley they called Pierre Flandeau. It was Pierre's second war. Paul Dupre came from the city of Limoges. He was a lawyer and had just won his first case. In Marseilles, the taxi driver Victor, la biche turned his cab over to an old friend. Victor was spoiling for a fight. Victor was always spoiling for a fight. From a great hospital in Paris came the fine young surgeon Fran?ois lamer. Andr? Duval was a wine salesman. Sure, he was a Frenchman, but he sold a lot of wine to Germans. Besides, business was good. You know how it is. From the cathedral at Rennes came the good father Sebastian. Yes, even from a concentration camp came Antonio Rodriguez, a Chilean. He fought wherever the people's armies were on the march. And so our proud French army was assembled. We believed it was the greatest fighting force in the world. Then the Boche struck, and within 2 short weeks, we were scattered across France like a torn patchwork. Some surrendered. Some retreated to fight on. Some held their ground. And then one night a truce was declared. But none of us could hear. Our communications were destroyed. On a thousand roads, a sergeant, a corporal, a private had to decide each for himself what his own lost unit should do. Commanding officer, sector 21, company 4. Colonel Demas speaking. Marshal Petain has requested an armistice and ordered that fighting be stopped. This division surrendered. You will now be addressed by an officer of the German army. French soldiers... Your commanding officer has told you officially that an armistice is being arranged. The war has been short and merciful. Now it is over. Our fuhrer has commanded all soldiers of the Reich that Germany and France shall be friends. We will work side by side with you to establish the new order and create greater prosperity for all Europe. Lay down your arms. You will be demobilized and returned to your homes and families to begin rebuilding France. Dirty bush trick. It's a German with a French uniform. No! It is colonel Demas. Come on. don't these Nazis believe in food? Did you ever see G?ring? My mother's a wonderful cook. Listen to those wheels. Baked potato, baked potato, baked potato. Nah, you're wrong. It's crepe suzette, crepe suzette, crepe suzette. Stop it, will you? It isn't funny. My wife's a good cook. Not bad-looking either. Dark, not fat. Slightly on the plump side-- Which I like. And her skin is the color of milk before you separate the cream. And my baby's just like her. You probably won't recognize the kid. I didn't mine last leave. Gee, it's really a wonderful time to go home. What? There's no business for a lawyer in the summer. Nobody sues. So I'll go out to my folks' place, spend 2 or 3 days just eating. No fishing? 10 weeks fishing. See anything? Nah! I'll go crazy if I don't get out of here soon. I guess I got that... What do you call it? Claustrophobia. Yeah. I wonder what Paris will be like. Not quite the same, but still Paris. It will stink of Sauerkraut. Cheer up, Victor. Relax. How can a man cheer up when he's licked? Victor. You'll get over it... And so will France. You'll get your turn next time. What do you mean, next time? Well, France was defeated in 1870, and she was strong again by 1914. We crushed Germany in 1918. This was her turn. Maybe Hitler doesn't believe in taking turns. It's a law of nature. I don't know anything about laws of nature. All I know is we surrendered, and I don't like it. You and people like you don't seem to mind it. One of us is awful wrong. Why do you suppose we are being sent home? Because Hitler has a kind heart? No. Because it's good business for him to get French industry and agriculture going again. Right. So we go back to work, and we start to build France up for the next time. I'll be too old to fight by then. I wish I could believe you're right. Don't worry. It makes sense. Whatever the course of history or politics, I'll still be practicing law in Limoges, and you'll be a doctor in Bordeaux, and Victor will drive his cab in Marseilles. And I'll sell my wines. He's perfectly right. Believe me. Say, we're all going to be better off than we've ever been before. Just a minute, Duval. What I was saying... Doesn't mean I'm glad we lost the war or that I'm not aware of the hard times ahead of us. No. Times won't be hard at all. You wait and see. With peace, we're going to have the biggest boom we've had in ages. Ask me. I know. How do you know? My business. It's taken me in and out of Germany a lot in the last few years. You know, you guys don't realize what miracles are happening there. You turn my stomach. What are you going to do with a man like that? Kill him. Well... My friend, your humor's a little crude. We don't kill people for their political convictions, Rodriguez. I used to hear that in Spain, too. Then the fascists attacked Madrid. 4 columns outside and a fifth column inside. We lost. Listen. We're going over a bridge. A river. The seine! You see anything? Nothing but sky. Say, maybe we're in heaven. It's Paris. I'd know that smell anywhere. I say heaven smells like Paris, too. This ain't France. Germany. Germany. Germany. What did you expect? How much longer are they going to keep us standing here? They didn't want to get their pretty boots dirty. It won't be long now. Look. My sole aim as commandant of this camp is to carry out the war policies of the Third Reich. You are prisoners of war and shall continue as so until your remaining ally's completely exterminated. This is not a concentration camp where isolated cases of resistance are treated. This is a military prison. You've all resisted the new order. Those among you who fought us against your better judgment will be recognized and given preferential treatment. For the rest, discipline will be just. Minor infractions of the rules: Punishment--cutting of rations. Serious disturbances: Punishment-- solitary confinement. Treatment up to the discretion of the guards. Attempts to escape: Punishment--death. Who among you speaks German? You will translate for captain Karlruch. If your work is satisfactory, you will remain interpreter for the camp. Yes, Herr Major. Thank you, sir. Barracks 27. Name? Jacques Batrue. Occupation? Barber. Barracks 27. Name? Francois Lamer. Occupation? Doctor. How is it that there's an officer with the enlisted men? They're my friends. Eh? Assigned to the infirmary. Name? Well, you know my name. Name. Pierre Flandeau. Occupation? Farmer. You know that-- Barracks 27. Victor, la biche, taxi driver. Unemployed at present. Barracks 27. Oh, yeah. Heil, uh... What was that name again? Take it easy. Nah, I'm alright. They make mush out of his head, he's alright. Who slugged me? Yeah. Touchy, aren't they? Victor, you might as well get it into your head. We are in a military prison. While we are only across the border from France, this is obviously only temporary until England-- "obviously, obviously." You know all the answers, don't you? Oh. Let you keep your cigarettes and take away your matches. Maybe you can figure out a way to get me a light. You might use the heat of your indignation. Hello. I'm father Sebastian. Hello, father. How are you, father? Your friend here is right. Mere gestures won't improve your condition. But they improve my soul, father. Hi! How's everything? Say... This isn't so bad. You know, things could be a whole lot worse. What's the matter? Now, wait a minute. Did I hurt anybody by taking the interpreter's job? Somebody's got to do it. Oh, Dupre! Look, is it true that you speak German, too? Yes. You know, I could recommend you to Lieutenant Schmidt. Please don't bother. Is anybody interested in food? Food! What about it? It's about time. When do we get it? Any time now. You see? That's one of the advantages of my job. I get things straight from the horse's mouth. Crawl out of here before I vomit. What's that for? Oh, I don't know. It's a sort of a combination-- A calendar and a ledger. Every day I'm here, I make a notch. One more Nazi to kill when I escape. Hey, bread! Cut it out! Victor, use your head. That's what they want us to do-- Fight amongst ourselves. That's why they give us this one little loaf. Well, of all the dirty, pointless-- Dirty, yes, but not pointless. When that trick succeeds, you will witness a major victory of the new order. Guess I had my share, father. You forget you're a prisoner. Don't you know religious services are forbidden? We were only giving thanks to god for our food. You would be better off to thank the fuhrer. Move it! Move it! Oh! Watch what you're doing! Oh, shut up. Take it easy, now. Don't start any trouble. You... swine! Yeah, Paul? Paul! Take mine. I'm not hungry. No, thank you, father. Hey, that isn't enough for a man. I'm hungry. You can't do this to us. This is not a concentration camp. We got rights! Too bad Pierre got himself slugged. Don't get too upset. Yeah, I guess that's right. Hadn't been for him, the rest of them would have eaten. If you can call it that. You know, a fella like you shouldn't be eating that slop. What do you eat? Squab? No. No, not squab, but not that muck. You really want to know what I eat? Soup. Real vegetable soup. Sometimes even a piece of meat in it, and you could do the same thing if you'd use your brains. Ah, forget it. Here. Maybe a few good smokes will take away the taste of that stuff. Go on, keep them. They are French. Sure. So is this. Bought them in Forbach, just across the border. You? You have been in France? Shh! The German officers send Sergeant Berger over to buy stuff for them. Soap, champagne, perfume. I go along to bargain with the French shopkeepers. But don't you have any trouble crossing the border? Nah. There's a big hospital in Forbach. We take a wounded man over for treatment, then bring him back. He's very sick. All wound up in bandages, even his face. The sick man's Corporal Daxer. We take our purchases and put them under his cot in the ambulance. Naturally, he's too sick to be moved. Simple? Yeah. Tell me, what's happening in France? Just like you said. Like I said? Certainly. The wise ones are collaborating, getting along fine. The others... Pfft. What about the others? There aren't very many of them left. You know... You're alright. Yeah. I like you. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you. So long. When I came here, I thought dysentery was something only chickens got. You'll feel better after you've had a sleep, my son. Yeah, if we don't get some bismuth pretty soon, we'll all be asleep-- In a cemetery. Cemetery? The Germans don't Bury you. They make soap out of you. Hey! The searchlights have gone out. Hey! There's no guard in the tower. That's funny. Maybe they burnt out the fuse. No. All of the lights wouldn't be on one circuit. Might be the dynamo. What are we waiting for? It's a trap. Even German machinery can break down. 100 to 1 it's a trap. It's 100 to nothing in here. They beat you into making a break-- I could be over that wire in one minute. They can shoot you awfully dead in one minute. We're wasting time. I'm going. You're mad! You haven't got a chance! I listened to you in the freight car, lawyer. Wait a minute. Not all at once. Too much noise. I'll go see what's what. You follow. Why you? Yeah. Why you? High card. We'll cut 3 ways. Father, I'm hungry. I know I should be thinking of Pierre in there dying. I should be praying for him. But I've never been hungry before. Why don't they take a machine gun and kill all of us? Paul, we're all hungry. We mustn't give in. How is Pierre? Still alive. It's amazing how long a man can live with his belly full of lead. Tell me, did you get the pass for father Sebastian? I tried. You know, you don't realize how difficult it's been for me to get you the run of the infirmary. Sorry, father. No religious ceremonies, you know. A dying man may not have the solace of his priest. Well, I don't make the rules, father. I just carry them out. Come on, Paul. Duval, did you tell him that our men were starving, that no one in the barracks has been fed since Pierre was shot? The major realizes that, father. In a way, he holds everybody in the barracks responsible. But he feels you could have stopped Pierre from doing this foolish thing. Then tell the major that hungry men go mad. When the time comes that they've nothing to lose, they'll-- Father. Hey! You don't realize your own strength, father. Come on, Paul. What about father Sebastian? They won't let him come in. Did you tell them that the man is dying? The swine invented a dozen alibis. Isn't there any chance? There might have been, anyplace but here. Doctor. Doctor! Stay with him till I get back. Yes. You look much better. Father Sebastian. Take it easy. He's coming. He must come quick. Hurry. Hurry! Father! What have they done to you? I don't know. Pierre? Yes. He was asking for you, father. We shall have a burial service. Religious services are absolutely forbidden. "Forbidden." that's all I ever hear around here is "forbidden." Aren't you ever going to learn? What's the matter with you--scared? Yeah. Scared to death they'll get me before I get my share of fascists. We shall have a burial service for Pierre. Please continue with what you were doing. You know what those weeds are going to taste like. Like the stuff that makes them grow. I'm sorry, Ren?. Something was stinking up the place. For a minute, I thought it was the weeds. Look, fellas, let's not start anything that's going to make any trouble, huh? Victor was right. It's not this stuff that's smelling. Listen, I've been trying to warn the boys-- for their own sake. Maybe they'll listen to you. They already have. Please, Dupre, I've spoken to Major Bruhl about you. Don't spoil it now. You better sit down and shut up. No. No, I don't want any part of this. We commend to thee, o lord... The soul of thy servant Pierre Flandeau. Give all of us, o lord, the strength of our departed brother, who saw the folly of abject submission to the oppressor and the glorious, exultant death in thee, which cometh only to the man who's true to himself and to his divine origin. Let not the spirit of evil, which has made thieves and criminals and murderers disguise themselves as soldiers and judges, prevail in this world. Let us live in the fear of no man... But only in fear of thee. And deliver us, o lord-- Come here, la biche. La biche, you are guilty of a fault too often found in your countrymen's stupidity. At the same time, you have demonstrated a quality very dear to the hearts of those who are responsible for the new order... Spirit. Duval has told me that you are a born leader. But with leadership, one inherits great responsibilities. If instead of keeping alive old hatreds, you would work for the ultimate good of your people-- How can any German know what's good for my people? Perhaps we know what's good for you, la biche. I'm a Frenchman. Nothing can ever change that. Nothing? What must I hear about you? You've been a very bad boy. Spit a guard in the face. Tsk-tsk. Very bad manners. Very bad. Oh, you want a cigarette? Don't feel sorry for father Sebastian. Envy him. But you're the one who didn't want-- He died for the things he believed in. No man can ask for more than that. But Victor's the one who's in solitary. But you have no proof Duval had anything to do with it. You've never been in solitary, have you? You still have no proof. I saw with my own eyes. He went right up to Daxerand, whispered in his ear and gave him the "Heil Hitler." I've been onto him for months. I hate him as much as you do, but he's a Frenchman, and he's entitled to a fair trial. We fought for democracy. We can't forget it now. Alright. We'll be democratic. All in favor of killing Duval, raise your hands. Satisfied? No. It's still nothing but murder. Would any of you like to be tried at a mock trial like this? To be sentenced to death without... Without a word in your own defense? Well? Would you? Hello. What's going on? Hello, Duval. Come here. Well, Duval, how are you? Fine. Hello! Say... You know, that was a pity about Victor. If he-- If he'd only listened to me... It's a joke. You keep away from me. Keep away from me. Keep away from me! Please keep away! You'll never get away with this. I'm an important man here. Aah! Please don't-- Oh! I'm hurt! I... Fellas, I... I'm a Frenchman... Like the rest of you. I'm hurt. Please. Stop! No! Don't shoot! It's me--Duval! It's me--Duval! This is me--Duval! Sergeant! Sergeant Berger, don't let them shoot! There's not the slightest doubt that the prisoner Duval was deliberately murdered. I've decided that a ratio of 10 lives for 1 will be sufficient. Had the murdered man been a German, the figure, of course, would be much higher. Count them off. Taking every fourth man. Those selected will be shot tomorrow morning at 9:00. 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! Won't you at least tell them to wait? G-Give me a chance to-- There would really be no point to it. I'm familiar with all the arguments you might use. That's always been one of our greatest strengths-- Our secret weapon, you might say-- That our psychological approach to what we do is so far ahead. Major Bruhl. I hope you see the mistake you made, Dupre. You thought I would be disturbed by the thought that the prisoners would hate us. Well, we expect that. But we also know that they'll fear us, so they'll work for us. With continued education, their children should like us and their children's children love us. Please stop them! Your German is exceptionally good. Sit down. So... discipline is maintained and poor Duval avenged. You were a friend of his, weren't you? I... I guess you'd say so. He spoke very well of you. Did he? I have a feeling you will suit the job much better than he did. Job? Yes. You are to replace him. You must have gathered by now that I didn't see you to listen to your emotional arguments. I hope you don't have outbursts like that very often. No. Good. We have most of our troubles with men who let their emotions run away with them. Though, of course, there's no such thing as a man we can't handle. Come. Come with me. These are run-of-the-mill cases. Routine treatment is all that is necessary. But here... Go ahead. Talk to him. It might prove enlightening. Victor. You see what I mean? What do you do now? Just let... Just let him die? He'd be of no use to us dead. No. We'll send him back among his comrades and let them see there's no one the new order can't break. I wouldn't count on this particular case, Major. I... Unless I miss my guess, he's... He's dying or pretty near it. That's impossible. Corporal! A few weeks in the infirmary, and he'll be himself again. Well, not quite himself. You see, we amputated his enthusiasm. With god's help, I think I can save him. What do you want to save him for? 'It isn't bad being killed. It's much better than to die. Dying--that's what's happening to all of us. Don't you see it? First our courage burns out, our self-respect, after a while, hope. Then the carcass lives on, but the man is dead. You don't see it, do you? But you see it. Heil Hitler! You know, I hear there's a rat around here that's got a new uniform. Beautiful new boots. They're not new. They're Duval's. Say, that's right. I guess they plugged up the bullet holes. He goes to the major to plead for his friends, comes out with a nice new job. You just won't try to understand, will you? Go shove a swastika down your throat and spin it. How is Victor? There he is. You look a lot better. Don't take it too hard. I understand their feelings. What's the good of it all, Paul? It hasn't helped you or us. You haven't been able to get me a few simple medical supplies. I tried again this morning. Did you tell the major we've got 1,500 cases of dysentery and no bismuth? Yes. Practically, no chloroform left. What do they want me to do, cut a man wide-open with his eyes staring up at me? I know. That is what they want me to do. There's nothing you can do about it. There's nothing any of us can do inside this barbed wire. What do you mean? Just what I said. That's Berger coming back. Back from France. France? But I thought not even the Germans were allowed across the border. Official business for Lieutenant Schmidt. Official business? What do you mean? Champagne, silks, perfume. Corporal Daxer is on a stretcher all bandaged up. Berger puts the packages under the stretcher, and that's how he gets over the border. He'll be wanting me to help him. Dupre, look at that idiot! Unfold him. Yes, sir. We know he's sick... But if you do not keep your mouth shut, I'll make you very sick-- Too sick to live. Dupre, Major Bruhl wants to see you. Oh, thank you, sir. Sit down, Dupre. Thank you, sir. How do you like your work? Very much, sir. Good. I guess you have discovered if you'll meet us halfway, we are not such brutes after all, hmm? The rest of the world has the idea that we are contemptuous of good will. But I know and you know that the fuhrer, above all else, is a realist. Dupre... We are going to start releasing some prisoners. We'll begin with the Alsatians. And for every prisoner released, 4 Frenchmen will be given the opportunity of working with our labor battalions here in Germany. We're releasing these-- 150 of them in the morning. Send them home, put them to work, see how they behave. They'll be assembled at 4:00, and your job will be to fill out identification tags for each prisoner with their name, rank, and home address. Tonight you'll give each man his tag, after checking with the list. They'll be shipped by truck. Roll call afterwards, as usual. Is that clear? Quite clear, sir. That's all. Thank you, sir. Berger! Berger. I hope the lieutenant is happy with the things you brought-- And please remember, when I am wanting you to speak, I am going to let you know! Berger. Look at this, Dupre. Charlotta, my wife, sent me a drawing of her foot for size, and then this... This idiot gets shoes that are too small. But you yourself said 9, sir. What difference what I said! My wife-- Look. It's easily 2 sizes too small. And what kind of cheap silk is that? But the shopkeeper said-- The shopkeeper said? The shopkeeper said? Berger, is a German soldier to be outwitted by a shopkeeper?! Excuse me, Lieutenant. Huh? I'm afraid Sergeant Berger is a victim of circumstances. You know those French shopkeepers. It takes the devil himself to bargain with them... Or else another Frenchman. I should imagine you had better luck when Duval made the trips, didn't you? Much better! This ring, a gold watch, other jewels. Duval delivered. Yes. Whereas this... This... Excuse me, Lieutenant, if you don't mind. I know the bourgeois mentality of the French shopkeeper. I believe I could change those shoes and bring you most anything you like, if you'd care to let me go with the sergeant on the next trip. Dupre, I like-- Dupre, I like the way you talk. Yeah, I think I'll give you a chance. Thank you, sir. Berger, you go again early tomorrow morning. What about the roll call after the Alsatians leave? Well, then go after the roll call. Yes, but, sir, it's better to be in Forbach when the shops open, before the stock is sold. But I could start the roll call, and then Sergeant Dahlinger could finish. Dahlinger? Yes, it would be good if we could get there as early as possible. Ja. It's alright the way you say, Dupre. Thank you, sir. Dupre. Francois... Wake up, Francois. I've overslept. Tell me... Is Victor well enough to travel? What are you talking about? Shh! Escape. Don't mention that word. Listen to me. Somehow, someday, this will all be over. Let's try to be alive when it is. Listen. Tomorrow, 150 prisoners from Alsace are to be released. That's fine for the Alsatians. The men will be identified by tags. I made them out. I wrote 15 extra tags for the men in our barracks. Once over the border, they can jump from the trucks, make their way to unoccupied France and later perhaps to England and Generale de Gaulle. But where do you expect to meet? In Cadignan. Cadignan? Yes. That's Ren?'s home. Oh, here's Victor's. Have him ready at 4:00. When the Alsatians assemble in the courtyard, he can slip in among them from here with a tag in plain sight. What about you, Paul? Oh, they'd recognize me. Well? I am going shopping in the ambulance with Sergeant Berger. By the way, I'll need some bandages to fix up Corporal Daxer. Here's yours. Thanks. What is it? Paul, it's right that you and Victor and Ren? should go. You're soldiers. You can fight again. My job is here. Das ist alles. Where's Victor? I've been watching the infirmary. He hasn't come out. What's wrong? I can't do anything with him. Victor... Shut up. 2 trucks have already left. Hurry up. Shut up, you fool! If they ever hear you... No one can hear us. Come on. Get dressed. I'm not going. But everything is planned. And have you planned how to keep the blood from leaking out of you when they shoot you full of holes? Another truck is leaving. They have only one left. Shh! They're everywhere. Victor, please! I don't care. Let him gamble with somebody else's hide. But, Victor, after what you have been through, you can't. Don't tell me what I've been through. Examine him. Hey, what is the matter? Nothing. Dupre, what are you doing here? Do you live in this infirmary or what? No. I just came to get the bandages. Shut up. Yes. There goes the last truck. We will be leaving in 15 minutes. I'll just start the roll call. The tough man, huh? Well... Do not spit in people's face anymore, huh? Ha ha! Disgusting. Dupre? Pansy. It's getting light. You better go, Paul. Paul, here's a little money that I managed to hide. Maybe you can use it. You better go, Paul. Berger will be ready in a minute. I am not going, Francois. I am not going without Victor. What are you talking about? You can't stay here. In half an hour, they'll find out about the men escaping. They'll line you up against that wall. I know, but... Barracks 1, 2, and 3. I can't go without Victor. The men are assembling. They've started the roll call. Look. You can't do any more. If Victor wants to stay, why, there's no reason for you to commit suicide. Paul, go now. It's not only Victor. It's all the men who thought the worst that would happen to them will be to die... And then discovered that death could be a luxury. Don't you see, Francois? I, and all the people like me, we got all the Victors into this. They wanted to fight... And we didn't. So now, somehow, whether he likes it or not, I've got to get him out of here. Paul, the last truck is gone. There is still the ambulance. Oh, forget it. Victor won't go with you. I know. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can you do it? How are you going to get rid of Daxer? Come here. Barracks number 4, 5, and 6, attention for roll call. Barracks number 7, 8, and 9, attention for roll call. He'll be out for a couple of hours. Barracks 10, 11, and 12, Paul, you haven't got much time. Will you be needing this? No. Will you? Yes. It's hard to believe that you're the same Paul. I am not. Paul, when he comes to, he'll be pretty helpless. The people outside will be too frightened to help. I'm not counting on anyone but myself. If we can only get over the border before they get to 27. You will. Barracks number 13, 14, and 15, attention for roll call. You drive. Halt. Barracks number 16, 17, and 18, attention for roll call. Very good time. We are nearly at the border. Isn't there any danger that they-- Oh, not going this way. Coming back, eh, but it is alright. Oh, I better tell this idiot. The border. So what--border? Nothing to be excited about. Papers are in order. Everything is fine. The elite guard. Hmm! These SS Men... Always trying to show off their power. Look. Your countrymen... Volunteers for labor. We can move. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Very good, Dupre. You surprise me. Very cool you was. Here. Reward. You know, Duval, the first time, the idiot, he nearly got us arrested almost... By SS Guard. They're not the only people who are clever. What is? Look for yourself... In the mirror. Hey, are you crazy again? It is only motorcycle. Maybe it's the SS. That is possible. Hey, turn off to the next road. We will see if they follow. It follows. It is your fault, you dummkopf! By going more speedy, you made them suspicious. Stop the car. Stop! Do you hear me, you swine? Stop it! Aah! Come on. We've got to go. Look. If we stay here, we'll starve. They fed us in prison. It was slop, but they fed us. Doesn't your freedom mean anything to you? Freedom? We're in occupied France. Behind every tree there's someone waiting to turn us in. And even in occupied France, there are thousands of fighting Frenchmen working with Generale de Gaulle. We'll find some of them. They'll help us! No. You can't get away from the Nazis. Nobody can. Come on, now. Shh! Victor! Listen! Someone's following us. Say, aren't you a little young to go around shooting people? He was a German. Who are you? Escaped prisoners. Keep your mouth shut. He'll turn us in. Didn't you see what he did? My friend is sick. You see, we... We haven't had much food for several days. What cross do you bear? What do you mean? I thought so. Another Nazi trick. You really are escaped prisoners. I'm sorry. My mother and father were shot for trying to help escaped prisoners. They weren't escaped prisoners. They were Nazis in French uniform. It's mostly water, but there's some wine in it. See, it's wonderful to hear that there are still French people who fight. Thousands and thousands of us, and we're organized, too. We have our own officers and our own meeting places, the same as any army. How do you identify each other? When someone says, "what cross do you bear?" You answer "the cross of Lorraine." It was Joan of arc's emblem, and now it's the emblem of the fighting France, its marking side by side by the Americans in Africa. In Africa? Haven't you heard? The Americans landed in Africa days ago. Victor, do you hear that? The Americans are in Africa! If we could only get to Cadignan. Cadignan? Yes. We have friends there. Soldiers? Yes. Wonderful. The underground will always help men who will fight for France again. We'll get you to Cadignan. As easy as that? Well, not at all easy, but be assured, sir, it will be done. Come on. Only 3 more kilometers. Victor, is it really true that when father Sebastian was killed, you knocked out 3 Nazis with your bare fists? Cadignan. Cadignan. What's the population of Cadignan? 374, Major. Good. So we will conscript-- Forgive me. We will accept 50 volunteers for our labor corps from Cadignan. We'll start there tomorrow morning. If you please, ma'am... I'm very hungry. So is everyone. But someone said mother Marchand is very kind because she once had a son who was a poor prisoner in Germany. They said his name was Ren?. You better come inside. Jacques! Victor! Paul! Oh, I never thought I'd see you again. Never! Oh, will Rodr?guez be surprised! The tough guy himself! Paul, how are you? You boys must be hungry. Oh, thank you. Sit anywhere. Look. Home-cooked food. We've had our dinner. This was all just camouflage, but I'm so happy to feed you with what we have-- Just a little soup. Believe me, we're happy to be fed. You know, Paul, it's lucky you arrived tonight. We're waiting for word now. We were beginning to doubt you'd ever get here. Well, we had our share of luck. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. That's our luck. Keep right on eating. Go on. I've seen him! Victor! He's one of us. Paul! Where have you been? Who have you seen? A great fighting French general. He calls himself Cartier. Cartier. He's up in the mountains. He leads a French army-- 5,000, 8,000, 10,000 men and more and more joining every day. Planes fly over every night-- American and British. They drop guns and ammunition, even medical supplies. There's a lot of dead Nazis stinking up the mountain passes that had their guts shot out by Frenchmen. I tell you, friends, it's war again! War? Yes, yes. Can't you see it? Not that we're winning, not yet, but it's a start. Like fire to field, it spreads. Before you know it, it's blazing in a dozen places at once, then 100! Nothing on earth can put it out. Nothing! No need to go to north Africa. We can stay right here in France, fight on our own ground. Let's leave for the mountains tomorrow. Feathers! Real feathers. You know... This isn't just a roof over our heads. It's a home. It has been a happy home. You can feel it. And it will be again. It's... it's to bring that happiness back to millions of homes all over France that we're going to fight again. And that's really something worth fighting for. Ha! Tomorrow morning... Think of it, you old war-horse! We are to fight again! I'm not going. But, Victor! I'm not going! Can't you get it through your head? My guts are gone. I can't fight. I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight again ever. I-- I'm afraid. It would be stupid of me to say I know how you feel. I guess no one ever could know who hadn't been chained in that cell, crucified on a wall, and still have the guts to spit in a Nazi's face. We'll leave in the morning. Somehow, I'll find a way to get you to north Africa. You'll be safe there. Now you better get some sleep. I'm going downstairs and talk to Rodr?guez. I heard what you told Paul. I didn't mean to. It doesn't matter. When I killed my first Nazi, I fell down and cried. And I threw up. You're too young for such work. To spit in the face of a Nazi when you were chained. I'd never be that brave. That was a long time ago. And to be whipped. I've seen the scars on your body. When I'm afraid again, I'll think of those scars, and I'll try to be as brave as you are, Victor. It's a labor battalion! Come on! Come on! Attention! You give me your attention, please! To the people of Cadignan-- "all able-bodied men of the village "between the ages of 15 to 65 "are given the opportunity to serve the cause "of Franco-German collaboration. "You will go to Germany, work in the factories. "You will be well-paid, well-fed, well-treated. "The families of volunteers will receive special consideration. "A quota of 50 volunteers has been set for the village of Cadignan." Who is the first to volunteer? You are not a Frenchman. Now, this is a man who knows what to do. Come on. Who is next? Quick! Uh, Major, if I may make a suggestion. I know how to bargain with these stupid peasants. Let me talk to them. Go ahead. Thanks. Friends... You have just been promised food, good pay, good treatment by the Germans. I know what it means when the Germans make a promise. I heard a promise made by an official of the Third Reich when I was a soldier at the front. The Germans promised that if we surrendered, we'd be sent back to our homes, and we were sent to a prison camp, beaten and starved. The Germans lied, and they are lying to you right-- You swine. You dirty Nazi swine! Aah! Come on. Let's get them! These are the last! Paul... Are you alright? Our fight is just starting. Yes. The Germans will be back. Friends! Victor, tell them! Alright, Paul. Listen, everyone. Listen to me! The Nazis will be back. What do you want to do--wait for them? No! You know what the people did in China and Russia! That's it! Burn their own homes! Destroy their villages! Good. No! Not burn our own homes! Oh, I know it takes courage to burn our homes, but since when have we been lacking in courage? Come on! Let's scorch the earth! They'll find nothing but ashes when they get here! Then we'll join General Cartier and fight.
