- Full left rudder. - Full left rudder. - A little late this year Kelly. - It's April, ain't it? April hell, it's June. - Who is he, captain? - Name is Kelly. - One-third leeward. - One-third leeward sir. - Yellowstone Kelly? - That's what they call him. - Evening. - Evening. Those are real nice looking pelts, they're wolf, ain't they? Mostly. - Going to sell them at Fort Buford, are you? - I plan to. - My name is Harper, Anse Harper. - Mine is Kelly. I know. Hardly nobody on the big money that ain't heard of you Mr. Kelly. Oh? Sure a lot of skins. - Where you come by them? - Up the snake. - That's Sioux country. - That's right. You want prime skins, you go where the game is, where you find game, you find Indians. Makes it kind of hard stay alive, don't it? - Sometimes. - Mr. Kelly? Yeah? I'd be obliged if you let me buy you a drink. Ain't you kind of young to be going against river whiskey? - I'm 21. - Oh? Will be, in two years. That's different, come on. Well, well, well. Whiskey. - Leave the bottle. - Yes sir. Hey look. I thought it was against the law to sell whiskey to an Indian. What do you think he is sarge, a Sioux or a Blackfoot? He looks more like a Shoshone sheep eater to me. - Hey, why don't you go ask him? - You figure he can talk? - Oh, I don't know, go ahead, find out. - All right, all right. Hey, me and the boys here are trying to figure what tribe you run with. - I said... - I heard you. Hey, what do you know? He talks white. - You must be a tame Indian. - I wouldn't count on that. Sergeant, that's enough. - I was only... - I said that's enough. Yes sir. Getting to where the army don't care who it joins. Mr. Kelly, the Major Towns extends his compliments sir. He'd like to see you in the captain's quarters sir. - He would? - Oh yes sir, on the double sir. You tell your major I've been a long time dry, he'll have to wait. - He says it's important sir. - To him or me? - Well sir, he didn't say sir. - He didn't? - No sir. - Go ask him. Yes sir. That won't be necessary. - Oh sir, I was... - It's all right lieutenant, that'll be all. The captain told me you weren't one to take orders Mr. Kelly. - You could say that. - I'm major Towns. I wonder if I could have a word with you, alone. - It'll only take a moment. - Why not? - Pay the man. - Yes sir. I'll come directly to the point Mr. Kelly. I'm on my way to take over the garrison at Fort Buford. Now, my first duty there will be to jump the Sioux south of the Yellowstone... and drive them back to the Dakotas. The territory south of the Missouri is unmapped, unknown. That is, to everyone but you Mr. Kelly. It may come as somewhat of a surprise but... your exploits as scout for general Crook in Arizona territory against the Apache... as well as your activities here in Yellowstone country... have been widely acclaimed, both in army circles and in Washington alike. In short, I think you're the man for the job. Job? I need a guide Mr. Kelly, a guide to lead me to the Sioux. You need more than that, can't be but a handful of men at Buford. I trust you've never heard of the element of surprise. You ever go against the Sioux major? No, I'm not an Indian fighter, if that's what you mean. That's what I mean. The country south of the big muddy belongs to them. - The government doesn't think so. - They do. And they intend to keep it. The way they look at it, they're fighting for everything god gives anybody to fight for. I go leading you up the snake, like is not... you won't even have anybody left to bugle over you. The treaty of 74 clearly states... Words on paper major, they don't mean a thing unless they're lived up to. - But they have no right... - Not anymore, they don't. We whites saw to that. I understand you run your trap lines through Sioux territory for some time Mr. Kelly. Seven years. It couldn't be you're afraid of what might happen to your... fur trade if we were to tame the land, could it? Being as we're speaking plain out what we think major... couldn't be you're looking for a Sioux feather in your cap, could it? Meaning? Meaning promotion would come easy for a man that ran the Sioux out... might even make you a general, especially after what happened to Custer on the Horn. - I see we understand each other Mr. Kelly. - Do we? In other words, you refuse? In any words I refuse. Will you be staying on in Buford for a while Mr. Kelly? No. Seems like you would after being alone so long. As soon as I can unload my furs I'll be heading back up the Snake. Don't hardly give you much chance to spend your money, does it? I trade for traps, keep building up my string that way. One day I hope to have enough traps to set every game trail north of the Yellowstone. When that time comes I... I guess you'll be needing somebody to help you run your lines, won't you Mr. Kelly? I might. I don't suppose you'd... consider hiring somebody to go upriver with you till then. Say like a, a mule packer or a cook? - You're a cook? - Well I, I could learn. Got any idea what it's like to spend a winter in Montana high country... see nobody white, talking to yourself... all the time lonesome. You're young... too young, you wouldn't last in Indian country. First black, lonesome night come along, like as not I'd have to wipe your nose... - pack you back down the trail. - I could stay out the winter. - Not with me. - But why? Look boy, I like being alone. It's a good way. I intend to keep it like that. Been obliged to know you. - See you again next year Mr. Kelly. - You bet I'll be here. - Mr. Kelly? - Yeah? - Are you sure you won't change your mind? - I'm sure. Hey Indian, you and them other jackasses are blocking the army's way. Go around me. I'll do my best. - What you say your name was boy? - Harper, Anse Harper. You'll do Anse Harper. Come on, let's get out of here. The Snake. Mr. Kelly? - Mr. Kelly? - I see them. We can make it across this clearing, we got a chance. - Ain't we going to hurry? - Yeah, starting right now. Yeah, come on. Stay down boy, stay down. - What do they want? - They'll get around to it. - You are the one they call Kelly. - He is the one. We've looked for you many days, I am glad you've come. I didn't come, I was brought here tied up like a man damned dog eater. - Sayapi, is this true? - They ran, I was forced to give chase. - You were told to ride in peace. - I had no choice. - You're a liar. - Sayapi. Don't think you should take it easy Mr. Kelly? You can't back down, they can smell fear in a man's sweat. My nephew is young. His heart is bad toward all whites. And Gall, how is his heart? - You know my name. - Like I know my own. Gall Nahungpapa, chief of the Seven Nations... hater of whites, killer of women and small ones. - You believe that? - A man hears what he hears. You know me, but you do not remember me. Think back many years. I was but a warrior then. The river Fort soldiers had shot me and left me for dead at the mouth of the snake. You found me and cut the iron that kills from my body. Here. - Now do you remember? - I remember. You saved my life... and now you'll do the same for another. An Arapaho captive lies wounded in my lodge. The wound must be mended or the captive will die.. - All this for an Arapaho? - This one must live. Come. Burning up with fever. - She'll be dead before morning. - She will not die. There's nothing I can do. You will cut the iron from her body as you did from mine. Put a knife in her will kill her much quicker. For seven years I've allowed you to stay in our land to trap your game in peace. I've given you life as you gave me at the mouth of the snake. Now we're even, you will heal the Arapaho. And if I don't? I will kill you. Bullet in her spine. - What you going to do? - The only thing I can do, get me a blanket. - Yes sir. - Place my robe beneath her. There'll be blood. Take it. - We'll need more light. - Bring wood. And four stakes to tie her down with. Anse, get the mule ropes that ought to hold her down. No, the woman can stand the pain. I got to dig a bullet out of her spine, If she moves, is like to kill her. You'll do as told Sayapi. - She's my captive... - Tie her, tie her hard. - Get the ropes and bring some clean cloth. - Yes sir. She is ready. Mr. Kelly... is there anything I can do to help? - Know any prayers? - One. Say it. - Figure she'll die Mr. Kelly? - I don't know. Well, what will they do if she does? Depends. That's the trouble with Indians, you never know what they'll do next. They don't either. That Sayapi, I wish he'd take that grin off his face. Proud, counted coop on us. - Coop? - That stick he clubbed us with, coop stick. Horseback Indians figure anybody can stand safe off and kill a man... but if you can get in close enough to touch him and then ride away alive... that's something to tell your squaw about. Kind of crazy. Yeah, but that's the way they look at it. This never would've happened if I hadn't of let that horse go down under me. My fault, never should've brought you along in the first place. She lives. - We'll go now. - No, she may yet die. - This is true. - I've done everything I can. - Anse, get the horses. - Wait. I promised only to kill you if you failed. The unspoken part of such a promise is freedom if I succeed. Can it be that your word is no better than your mark? You sat on a blanket in Laramie and swore to kill no more white men. You would've them take away our land, our horses, drive us to the north? You gave your word. All the days of my people, no Indian has been the first to break a treaty. Go in peace, my brother. No, my uncle speaks with the tongue of a woman, I say... Now go quietly and give thanks I did not kill you. The Arapaho captive is made him like this. He is looked at her but she is not looked back, you understand? - I understand. - Then go in peace. Home. - Give me a hand with these packs. - Yes sir. As soon as we get this finished I'll water and... grain the animals, you dig up something to eat. Yes sir. What's that? Dove eggs. - Dove eggs? - Yes sir. A might too done, are they? A might. - Maybe if I got some... - Never mind. - Got any coffee? - Yes sir. If all the same to you I'll do the cooking from now on. If you give me some time I can learn Mr. Kelly. Not on me. - Where you going? - Get find something to build you a bed with. - Don't go to no trouble. - You can't sleep on the floor. Got a feeling this is going to be a long winter. Dove eggs. Mr. Kelly? You asleep? - That a wolf, Mr. Kelly? - I hope so. He stopped. The wolf. Yeah. Good night. Good night. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. - Give us this day... - Ain't you ever going to settle down? - What you mumbling about? - I was saying, I was saying my night prayer. Prayer? That's what my folks taught me. They know you're running around loose in this country, do they? No, sir. Fever took them, I'm alone. That is I was. Can't ride, can't cook. Come morning, I'll have to teach you how to pack a mule. Yes sir. That prayer, same one you said over the Arapaho, is it? Yes sir. Must be a good one. - Good night boy. - Good night Mr. Kelly. If I was you, I'd work from the side. I think I can handle from this end Mr. Kelly. Watch his ears. Watch his... You all right? I think so. - You want me to try again Mr. Kelly? - Not today. This keeps up, he's liable to forget his manners. If that happens, I'll have to shave his tail. Eh? The way the army does to let you know a green mule. One that hasn't been full broke, shave-tail they call them. You mean like a new lieutenant? It comes from there, boy officer, jackass, same thing. - Were you ever in the army Mr. Kelly? - Two years. - Where? - Oh, dry country mostly. - Arizona? - New Mexico, all down through there. Was scout for general Crook. You got to work and see an Indian coming for a mile, like that one up there. Come on. - The Arapaho. - Let's get her inside. - Is she dead? - About halfway. Got to get that fever down. - Strip her clothes off, I'll get some water. - Yes sir. - Mr. Kelly? - Yeah? I'll get the water. Mr. Kelly? Mr. Kelly. - We've come for the Arapaho. - I figured you would. - You'll bring her out. - Now. No. I thought we had looked at each other and spoken as brothers. - We did. - Then do as I say. She's in no shape to travel. Yet she can steal a war pony and ride to you in the blind night. It's not only the night that's blind. How could she know I was the one that cut the iron from her body? Her eyes were open only in pain while I was at your camp. She came to this valley by chance. - Lies. - You move her, it'll kill her. - Lies. - No, it is true. - She's my captive, I will take her now. - Sayapi, hear me. It is many miles to our winter camp. The Arapaho will remain until she is well. I hear you, my uncle... and I say you do not want me to take the woman because you would've her for yourself. I do not hunger for what is not mine, you'll do as I say. The woman is made you weak. - I take your orders no longer. - Sayapi. - Sorry I had to do that. - No matter, he is wanted to kill you. What about the woman? The big snow come early. When it is gone, I'll come for her. It's true, isn't it? What he said about you wanting her. When she is well, she can say for herself with whom she wishes to ride. Sounds fair enough. Remember, Sayapi will kill you if he can. I can not stop him. Look well to your watch fires my brother. Here, eat this. - You wish I had not come here. - I wish I'd never laid eyes on you. - Soon I will be well and then I will go. - Go where? To my people, beyond the land that burns. It's a hundred uphill miles to Arapaho country, you'll never make it.. - You could take me. - I could, but I won't. - You would let them come for me? - That's right. They will kill me. Not after all the trouble they've gone to keep you alive. Then I am still a captive. Depends on how you look at it. Winter will come early but that will not keep Sayapi away. He has looked at me. Hear me. I owe you my life... and when I am well I will cook, bear wood and water for you. I will do anything you ask... anything. But if I get the chance... I will steal a mule and ride to my people. - Mr. Kelly? - Keep your voice down. Yes sir. I tripped over the water trough. - The water trough? - I didn't hear you coming. Then you won't hear Sayapi either, I'd been him, I'd had your scalp hanging on my belt. Stumbling around in the dark like a knee walking drunk. - Well, I'm sorry. - Being sorry won't keep you alive. Next time, find yourself a dark spot and stay put. Now go on inside and get yourself some rest, I'll take over till midnight. - Mr. Kelly? - Yeah? How long are we going to keep this up, watching, waiting? Depends. - Do you think Sayapi will come back? - I know he'll come back. - I'd rather lose some sleep than my hair. - Yes sir. The woman, how is she? She ought to be on her feet in a week, maybe less. She sure is pretty. I guess she's about the best all over good looking woman I ever seen. - She ain't ugly. - No sir, she sure ain't. - Midnight? - Midnight. - I'll be back before dark. - Can I go along? Somebody is got to stay here and watch the woman. Maybe if we got her to give her word. That wouldn't do any good. She'd try anything to get back to her people. - She belongs there. - Then why don't we let her go? Took me seven years to build up my lines in this country. I can't throw it all away for a squaw. If Gall gets back he can have her. That don't seem right. Not talking about right, talking about staying alive. - I'll watch her. - You see that you do. - Can I help you with that? - I will do it. Mr. Kelly said I was to keep an eye on you... see that you didn't work too hard while he was gone. Gone? Up the Snake, checking the mouth string, he'll be back before dark. I can't say as I mind. Keeping an eye on you I mean. Come to think of it, I don't even know your name. - Wahleeah. - Wahleeah. That sure is pretty. - He has told you then? - Told me? That I would run away. He said if you got the chance you'd take off for Arapaho country. - I'm to make sure that you don't. - I see. - It ain't as if he don't want to help. - I know. - He is afraid of Gall. - Afraid? That is why he keeps me, why he will not take me to my people. He fears what they will do if I'm not here when they return. That ain't it at all. Mr. Kelly is got traps to run, fur to pack out of high country. He can't go chasing all over the Montana mountains for a s... A squaw? He saved your life. Only because they would've killed him if he had not. I'm going to wash my body in the river. - Has he told you to watch me here too? - Well, no. Then keep your eyes on the mule. I can not walk to Arapaho country. Yes ma'am. - What happened sergeant? - Sioux major, they jumped us upriver. - How many? - Couldn't tell. - They hit and ran sir. - We lost one man. You say they ran? - Yes sir. - South sir. - They're heading for their winter camp. - How do you know? Well, they got their dogs and squaws with them. Then we should be able to pick up their trail. Get another horse sergeant, you'll ride the point with me. Major... The Snake is crawling with Sioux sir... we get cut off in high country, we won't have a chance. Is my job to see that doesn't happen. - Yes, but if you ask me... - Nobody asked you sergeant. No sir, nobody did. Forward, ho. Major is in a hurry to get buried on a Montana mountain, come on. Sioux arrow. That means as the army is moving up the snake. Could be just a patrol. More likely the full garrison from Buford. That boy major, what was his name? Towns. Yeah, he said he was going to cross the Yellowstone and jump the Sioux. He'd try a fool thing like that? He does, the ground is going to be full of soldiers. I'll ride out first thing in the morning, see if I can pick up his tracks. There will be no tracks. Storm will come. You're right, rain before morning.. - What about the army? - They most likely follow the river. Give me a hand with the animals. We'll tie them out of the weather. - Wind will come from the north. - From the west. From the west. Grab yourself a rope. Snub them down tight, no telling how hard it'll blow. Yes sir. - Mr. Kelly? - Yeah? I've been wondering... do you figure we ought to think again about taking Wahleeah back to her people? Who? Wahleeah, the Arapaho. That's her name. Her father gave it to her. Means her eyes are the color of a clear summer sky. - It does, eh? - Yes sir. It's like you're getting to know that squaw pretty close up. I, I wish you wouldn't call her that. She been looking crossways at you, has she? What do you mean? You know what I mean, playing up to you. No sir. Well, if she does is because she wants a way out of this valley, nothing else. Yes sir. I, I guess a fella would be plain foolish to go thinking serious about an Indian. Taking her for a woman I mean. - But you've been. - Been what? Thinking serious. Well yes sir, so? You told her, have you? - Told her? - That you want her. - No sir. - Well, don't. Won't work. When you were a boy, you ever go out in the woods, catch something wild... a rabbit or a bird and take it home with you to keep? - Yes sir. - What happened? Well... I'll tell you what happened. It either got sick, ran away or died. It's the same way with an Indian. You go trying to tame them, make them live white... it just won't work. You bring that other saddle. Yes sir. I want to take a look at your back, turn over. It is well. Do like I tell you. - That hurt? - No. That? No. - Will be a scar. - Does not matter. You should've let me die. That what you've been telling the boy, so as to get him feeling sorry for you? Sorry enough to take you back to your people? Is that all you ever think of my running away? Look, I don't like this any more than you do. - Yet you keep me here. - You belong to Gall. - That is not the reason. - No? No. In the beginning you were afraid of what they would do to you if I ran away. And now? You have looked at me. - Looked at you? - A woman can tell without words. You couldn't get anywhere with the boy so now you're trying to work on me, is that it? You saved my life. I sleep beneath your blankets. So? Many things can happen before spring. You getting out of this valley ain't going to be one of them. We will see. No sign of them major. Must've doubled back in the storm. - Well then they crossed the river behind us. - Yes sir, and there's no telling where. Can we get the men across here sergeant? Yes sir, but don't you think we ought to circle high around and pick up their... - Corporal... - Yes sir? We're swinging south, have the rear guard close up on the main body. - Yes sir. - Lieutenant? - Yes sir? - I want... As you were. - Rejoin your men sergeant. - Yes sir. - Major. - Kelly. Planning on crossing the river, are you? I told you I was going to drive the Sioux back to the Dakotas. That's what I intend to do. Knew a man once... intended to kill a bear with a stick. - Buried him. - I fail to see the comparison. - You cross that river you will. - Now, look... No, you look major... Give or take a squaw, there's 1,000 head of Sioux south of the Yellowstone. As I said before Mr. Kelly... the element of surprise. They've had eyes on you ever since you left the mouth of the Snake. You let the Indians go unpunished for what happened at the Horn. Custer was a man full grown. And so am I Mr. Kelly. That's a matter of opinion. - Cavalry's ready to move sir. - Very well corporal. I'll tell you once more major, on this side you're in trouble... over there you're dead. - Lieutenant. - Yes sir? - Move the men across the river. - Yes sir. Column right, Ho. We've gotten this far without your help Mr. Kelly. You're a damn fool major. You're going back. Back? - To your people. - You will take me? Somebody is got to. - But Kelly... - He's got no right keeping you here. No right at all. He knows all there is about trapping, tracking... staying alive in wild country, he knows all about that. But he don't know about people... and what they feel inside. Don't matter if they're Indian, white or what. I'll get the horses. He will never forgive you. I thought about that. Thought about it a lot. He's wrong. Hope I'm right. I've packed... No. No. Anse? Anse. Anse. They took her Mr. Kelly. Sayapi. Yes sir. - We got to get her, we... - Take it easy. I... I was going to run off with Wahleeah. Take her to her people. Guess I've been nothing but trouble to you Mr. Kelly. You guess again. I don't ever want to leave this valley. Wahleeah says that it goes all green in spring. She says that god dwells in high country. Do you believe that? Yeah. Mr. Kelly... I didn't think I'd ever talk out against you... but... you're wrong. Wrong? Yeah, being alone it ain't a good way... not a good way at all. And... And Wahleeah, she needs you. And if you ask me, you need her, too. Find her, please find her Mister... You are my woman now and nobody can take you from me. Nobody. The land that burns. We'll follow it north, take you to high country. - High country? - That's what Anse wanted. Gall will kill you. He'll try. He's a great warrior. You'd have me turn you over to him? No man can take my love... must be given as the sun gives warmth to the gray of dawn. I would rather be dead than to be with Gall. I have not looked at him, I have looked at you. They caught us in a canyon, we didn't have a chance. - Where's the major? - Dead. I got to get these boys back to Buford Kelly, you got to help me.. - I can't. - You mean you won't. I mean I can't. - Do you figure they mean to hit us again? - Just as hard as they can. - We can make a run for it. - Wouldn't stand a chance. If I were you, I'd scatter my men in those trees. Well, you heard him lieutenant. - All right sergeant, scatter the men. - Yes sir, scatter. Why don't they come on? They're just sitting there. Got everything their way, they're no hurry. - Kelly... - Yeah? I didn't get a chance to tell you I was sorry. Sorry? How me and the boys done you at Buford. Seems to me it was the other way around. Yeah, guess it was at that. I wonder what he wants. You will give me the woman. You said she could choose for herself who she rides with. You'd have her die with the soldiers? - And if I give her to you? - You may go, in peace. - But not them. - They die. For every soldier you kill here there'll be 10 to take his place. I will fight them with the last breath of my body. Give me the woman. - She stays here with me. - You leave me no choice. Hold them. Hold your fire, hold your fire. Now. Hold your fire, hold your fire. They'll be back. Mr. Kelly, Mr. Kelly we can't stand off another one like that. Yeah, I know. Why don't you give them the squaw Kelly? Then you can ride out of here alive. - Me and the boys... - She stays. - Must be something special. - She is. She was coming to me to save you. She would give her life that you may live. She is chosen with whom she wishes to ride, take her and go in peace. - And the soldiers? - They die. How many loved ones will die before the fighting is over? How many will feel like we feel now? Take your warriors and go away from this place. This land no longer smiles on your people.
