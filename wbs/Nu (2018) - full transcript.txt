Hello. Where have you been?! Why weren't you at the rehearsal? My eyes hurt. So what? It's stopping you from singing? Are you okay? I hardly sleep. Get laid already! Good idea! Then come over on Friday and we'll solve the problem. That's fine. Hi! Don't be mad at me, I hate cigarettes, you know, but that's just the way it is! It's just really bad. Hi! Hi! What are you doing? I'm working. What happened? Don't you want to sleep with me? What?! Well, okay. My show ends at 7:00. Come downtown. Okay. Hello? Yes, hello. Where are you?! I'm coming. Well, I'm freezing, where are you? I'm coming, I'm coming. Hi! What's the matter with you? Is that makeup? Very funny. You don't want me anymore? Let's go get something to eat, huh? It's cool to be tall after all. You or me? His name is Misha. "Misha" is the same as "Mishka." It's funny that in Russian, the word "Misha" means: a little bear that is, he's a bear cub. And, really, he is a bear cub. He protects me from scary dreams, wherever I am, just turn away, and there he stands. He loves me, of course. Because love is such a thing as a cough: impossible to hide. And I'm sure everyone has such a bear cub. When you're around him, you can take no brains with you. He watches, he listens, he spoils. Who to sleep with? Who do you sleep with? I don't sleep at night. I walk at night in Moscow. It's winter. The night is long. Who to sleep with? With whom? With a man? A girlfriend? A cat? A dog? Who do you sleep with? I don't sleep during the day. I walk in the morning in Moscow. It's summer. The night is short. Who to sleep with? Who to sleep with? With the actor? With a neighbor? The blanket? I'm not a whore or a nymphomaniac. I'm just a nun. A nun, a nun. A nun, a nun. Well, my conscience wouldn't let me. But I don't love him as a man. It's not that he's all the same to me. He is, after all, a friend. That's why it would hurt him, I don't want to lose such a good friend, so I changed my mind at the last minute. Well, that's okay. Friday's coming up, Nika promised me, Nika promised me she'd introduce me to someone, right? But, we'll see what happens. Hey, where are you? There's nobody here. Man, I'm sorry, I'm running a little late. Anyway, what time will you be there? Vanya's there, I'll call him now! Who's Vanya? Well, you'll find out soon enough. Interesting. Hi. Are you Vanya? Yeah, you want some wine? Two glasses of red, please. Who says I drink? There are often disappointments in these situations. You expect one thing, you get another. But here I sit. Not going anywhere... Honestly, I just don't like to stay home alone. But right now I'm just so glad I came. I wonder where Nicky got such a handsome friend? Why haven't I even heard of him before? I'm communicating with him, and I have so many thoughts in my head! He must be a good man. He gave me a cigarette, so he smells good. When he started talking, I knew right away: I could sleep with him. And what would you have to do to do that? What's a hint? Or just honestly say, "I want to fuck you!" Oh, Lord, oh, beauty is power. I even forgot for a second that I'm Chinese, I should be more humble. And the word "fuck" is very uncultured... What are we talking about? I say all kinds of crap: that my name is Eva and I'm a psychologist. I want to go to Paris, but they didn't give me a visa. He must have believed it all. But someone exists in the world just to prove: it's very easy to deceive a man and what he says is so unimportant. "I want to kiss you." That's really good. Ugh, fuck... Be right back. Hello. Hey, I don't understand: where are you? I'm already here, Vanya didn't find you. Found you! I found it! Did you change your mind or did you leave? Or did Vanya hurt you? I told you that someone exists in the world just to prove that it's very easy to fool a person. It didn't work out because the guy is a jerk. It's just that I'm stupid. I got the address wrong, and they were in a different club altogether. I mean, I didn't meet Vanya, and I'm not sure if that guy's name is Vanya, too. I did what a real woman would do: as usual, I blew my happiness. Man, that's pathetic! He was so handsome! What?! Well, he was handsome. I'll write a song about it. Shit! I agreed with Dasha to make me new photos for the album. Tomorrow. I completely forgot! That's it! I need a mask and a good night's sleep to look good. Yes! Yes, yes. Head up and forward a little bit. Yeah. Stop! Freeze! Catch the light! By the way, when's your album coming out? Not until you give me a picture, it won't come out. Listen, I wanted to ask you, why do you only write in Russian? Well, because the person I'm singing to, unfortunately, only knows Russian. I like it. I say. I say you don't understand. You don't understand. You don't understand. I say. You don't understand. You don't understand. You don't understand. I say. You don't understand. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. I yell! I'm talking. I'm talking. I'm talking. Nu. I say. Nu. I say. You don't understand. You don't understand. You don't understand. I say. Nu. You don't understand. You don't understand. You don't understand. It's a very strange story. I don't even know how it happened. Oh, I'm embarrassed. I mean, it didn't work out because I had my period, but even if I hadn't had my period, it probably wouldn't have worked out either. Because, like, I kind of figured out for myself that I'm not gay, that's all. By the way people eat grapes, you can divide them into 2 groups. Group "A" eats grapes from the best to the worst. Group B, like me, on the contrary, starts with the bad grapes. Group "A" looks like optimists, because these people choose the freshest and unbroken grapes. Group "B" looks like pessimists, because the grapes that group "B" chooses are the worst grapes available. But, in fact, it seems to me that the opposite is true! Group "A" has only reminiscence, and Group "B" has hope. So I'm definitely going to find someone. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. - Your skin is so soft and smooth. - I don't shave. You don't shave? No. What do you mean, you don't shave? My hair doesn't grow. What do you mean? Just like that. Only on your legs, but not on your arms? Well, check. Same. Wait, everyone grows in their armpits. You don't! And on the nipples? Well, check, too. You're hard? Yeah, I'm hard. I'll be right back. What's going on? Shit, look, I'm sorry, I don't know, it's the first time it's happened. Well, it happens. Yes? I don't know. Oh, my God. Anyway, all right, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The bracelet. Go away. The mustache is a failure. Yeah, and I've never liked a man with a mustache, as you know. Yeah, that hasn't happened yet in my life just yet. Wow! Awesome! You know what the grudge is? I tried. I downloaded the program, registered, chose my photos - sexy, you know, the kind, put them out and watched carefully, leafing through the boy. I swear to you - he had other pictures! Oh, my God! It's a nightmare. And I probably shouldn't have laughed, of course, but what if he has a complex. I wasn't laughing at him, I was just laughing at the situation and at myself. That's ridiculous! I just wanted to sleep with someone, I just wanted to sleep with someone. It still doesn't work. I don't know what to do anymore. And he was nervous, of course, and so was I. It's his first time, after all. And, anyway, tomorrow's the concert, to be honest, I don't want to see you. It's not that I don't want to see you, of course I want to see you, but, man, why is everything so difficult? That's it, I have to go to bed. I got sick and I was late. I drank too much and got sick. I promised and I forgot how much I missed you. I called, I didn't say anything. I endured, I listened, I dried up. I hurt you for lying. You're not having fun. Fun. I was sorry, I didn't recognize myself. Far away I ran and very tired. And la-la-la-la again. How much I loved you. How much I loved you. How good that Sasha dropped by unexpectedly. The Russians say "the best things happen unexpectedly," and why not Sasha? I like the name. Shall we go to Nikita's on Friday? Yeah, why not!? It should be cool, he has something incredible going on there every time. Last time Fet was there with his new girlfriend. They were so drunk, they did such a crazy thing! It's crazy! Go away. Shall we go? Go away. What? Go away. Hey. If you don't want to go, don't go. Go away! That's enough. Go away! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Where am I going now!? Go away!!! You put a gun to my head. I close my eyes. And I'm dead, dead, dead... You hold my body in your arms, And you shake, And you apologize. "I'm sorry, please! It was an accident! And you cry and you cry and you cry and you cry. You hug me even tighter And you get lost. And you make excuses. "I'm sorry, please! It was an accident!", And you cry and cry. Crying and crying. Why so loud? It doesn't hurt you. You finally got rid of me. You should be happy. Don't cry, don't cry. Don't cry, don't cry. Cry, don't cry. Cry, don't cry. Cry, don't cry. Cry. I would forgive you. But I'm dead. How are you!? I called you 53 times. Why didn't you pick up? You got a new girlfriend? Is she a good fuck? Do you like her? Yes? Don't hang up, please! It's just, you've blocked me everywhere: I can't write you and I can't reach you. I have something to tell you. I guess I love you after all! I had sex, too. Yesterday. Open the door, please. I want to go home. How am I feeling right now? Well, it's really hard to explain. You know... you know, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry that I don't know Russian well, that I can't speak as much and carry my thoughts, what exactly I want to say. It's my fault that I'm Chinese and I fell in love with you. But you're good. It's just how to explain, I can't live without you. How can I explain that I love you so much? But, I didn't know it myself, I didn't know... So much has happened, but I still can't. I'm just dying. I want to talk so much, but I don't know how to talk. You don't understand anything. After all, my heart is harder than his dick. You're fucked. I didn't bury you, because if you really want to, you can still dig it up! Burning is our Chinese traditional funeral ceremony. I figured it was the only way I could free myself from you. I'm sorry, I know you're in a lot of pain, and so am I. But don't worry. Your soul is being reborn. Hey, Wicked, I'm here. Oh, my God, you scared me, you look good. Thank you! But you certainly are very cruel, setting me on fire. Well, these are punishments for your bad behavior, the most disgusting thing in the world is lying! Did you promise to love me for the rest of your life? I did. Did you promise to love only me? I promised. Who said you'd never leave me alone? Me. Aren't you ashamed?! Ashamed. Fuck you! I'm a cow and you're crazy. That's the way you loved it. Yeah, well, what are you gonna do next? I don't know, I won't love you anymore. You're a cow. It's not going to work out. I'm glad. Well, take care of yourself, and most importantly, don't fool around! You too, don't fool around. Well, goodbye! Everything will be all right, won't it? Yes, my love, everything will be all right. It's good that you're not dead. And it's good that I'm not crazy. I don't know if I've explained it to you enough, but it seems to me, if you want to understand me, you will. It's better to have loved than not to have met, isn't it? Oh, I forgot to tell you! "Nu" means "cow" in Chinese!
